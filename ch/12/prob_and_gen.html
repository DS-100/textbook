<h1 id="Probability-and-Generalization">Probability and Generalization<a class="anchor-link" href="#Probability-and-Generalization">&#182;</a></h1><p>We have introduced a sequence of steps to create a model using a dataset:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a model.</li>
<li>Select a loss function.</li>
<li>Fit the model by minimizing the loss on the dataset.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus far, we have introduced the constant model (1), a set of loss functions (2), and gradient descent as a general method of minimizing the loss (3). Following these steps will often generate a model that makes accurate predictions on the dataset it was trained on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a model that only performs well on its training data has little real-world utility. We care about the model's ability to <strong>generalize</strong>. Our model should make accurate predictions about the population, not just the training data. This problem seems challenging to answerâ€”how might we reason about data we haven't seen yet?</p>
<p>Here we turn to the inferential power of statistics. We first introduce some mathematical tools: random variables, expectation, and variance. Using these tools, we draw conclusions about our model's long-term performance on data from our population, even data that we did not use to train the model!</p>
