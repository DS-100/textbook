# Data Sources

All of the data analyzed in this book are available at the book's website, [LearningDS.org](https://learningds.org/) and on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DS-100/textbook/) for the book.  These datasets are from open repositories and from individuals. We acknowledge them all here, and include, as appropriate, the file name for data stored in our repository, a link to the original source, a related publication, and the author(s)/owner(s).

To begin, we provide the sources for the four case studies in the book. Our analysis of the data in these case studies is based on research articles or, in one case, a blog post. We generally follow the line of inquiry in these sources, but we have usually simplified the analyses to match the level of the book.
