    "In this chapter, we fit simple logistic regressions with one explanatory variable, but we can easily include other variables in the model by adding more features to our design matrix. For example, if some predictors are categorical, we can include them as one-hot encoded features. These ideas carry over directly from {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:linear>`. The technique of regularization ({numref}`Chapter %s <ch:risk>`) also applies to logistic regression. We integrate all of these modeling techniques---including using a test-train split to assess the model and cross-validation to choose the threshold---in the case study in {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:fake_news>` that develops a model to classify fake news."
