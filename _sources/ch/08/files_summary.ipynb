    "Data wrangling is an essential part of data analysis. Without it, we risk overlooking problems in data that can have major consequences for future analysis. This chapter covered an important first step in data wrangling: reading data from a plain text source file into a Python DataFrame. We introduced different types of file formats and encodings, and we wrote code that can read data from these formats. We checked the size of source files and considered alternative tools for working with large datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also introduced command-line-interface tools as an alternative to Python for checking the format, encoding, and size of a file. These CLI tools can be handy for simple filesystem-oriented tasks like those we described. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the shape and granularity gave us insight into  what a row in a data table represents. This helps us determine whether the granularity is mixed, aggregation is needed, or weights are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrated these concepts through examples, one on a large dataset from the DAWN survey and one on restaurant safety data that was organized in multiple files. Together, the wrangling techniques in this chapter help us bring data from a source file into a data frame and understand its structure. Once we have a data frame, further wrangling is needed to assess quality and prepare the data for analysis; this is the topic of the next chapter."
