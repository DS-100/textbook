    "3. Our initial explorations identified possible words that might be useful for prediction.  After fitting simple models and exploring their precision and accuracy, we further transformed the articles using tf-idf to convert each news article into a normalized word vector. \n",

    "When we write out the steps in the lifecycle like this, the steps seem to flow smoothly into each other. But reality is messy---as the diagram illustrates, real data analyses jump forward and backward between steps. For example, at the end of our case study, we discovered data cleaning questions that might motivate us to revisit earlier stages of the lifecycle. Although our model was quite accurate, the majority of the training data came from the 2016-2018 time period, so we have to carefully evaluate the model's performance if we want to use it on articles published outside that timeframe."

    "In essence, it's important to keep the entire lifecycle in mind at each stage of a data analysis. As a data scientist, you will be asked to justify your decisions, which means that you need to deeply understand your research question and data. To develop this understanding, the principles and techniques in this book equip you with a foundational set of skills. The world needs people like you who can use data to make conclusions, so we sincerely hope that you'll use these skills to help others make effective strategies, better products, and informed decisions."
