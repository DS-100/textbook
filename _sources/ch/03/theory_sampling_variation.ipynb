    "Probability sampling, also known as scientific sampling, uses a chance mechanism, such as drawing indistinguishable marbles from an urn, to select a sample from the access frame. The use of randomness in the selection process enables us to calculate the variation in our sample. In particular, we can compute the chance that we draw a particular sample, which is extremely useful when considering the accuracy of our data. We demonstrate these calculations with the most basic sampling method, the Simple Random Sample (SRS), and then introduce an extension of the SRS, stratified sampling. To explain both sampling methods, we use a small population of seven elements. The population is small enough that we can list all possible samples that might result from  these sampling methods and we can compute the chance of each possible sample.\n",

If we take a sample and give each chosen prototype a pressure test, then we might summarize our findings with, say, the proportion of prototypes in our sample that fail the test.  Each of our possible samples (remember, there are 35) gives us a summary statistic, a sample proportion. If units $A,B,D, and F$ fail the pressure test, then for each sample, we get a sample proportion that can be $0$, $1/3$, $2/3$ and $1$. For each sample, we can calculate its corresponding proprotion.

    "In advance of the election, polls are conducted separately in all of the states. The results help identify \"battleground\" states, and these polls are combined to predict the winner of the electoral college votes. In 2016, pollsters correctly predicted the election outcome in 46 of the 50 states. \n",
    "For those 46 states, Trump received 231 and Clinton received 232 electoral college votes.\n",

    "Many experts have studied the 2016 election results. According to the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), one online, opt-in poll adjusted their polling results for education but used only three broad categories (high school or less, some college, and college graduate). They found that had they separated out those with advanced degrees from those with college degrees, then they would have reduced Clinton’s margin by 0.5 percentage points. In other words, after the fact they were able to identify an education bias where highly educated voters tended to be more willing to participate in polls. This bias matters because these voters also tended to prefer Clinton over Trump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how people actually voted, we can carry out a simulation study that imitates the election polling under different scenarios to help develop intuition for accuracy, bias, and variance (see {cite}`grotenhuis2018`.

    "1. People surveyed didn't change their minds, didn't hide who they voted for, and were representative of those who voted on election day.\n",
    "2. People with a higher education were more likely to respond, which led to a 0.5% bias for Clinton.\n",
