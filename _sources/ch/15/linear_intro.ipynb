    "veterinarians used a linear model (see {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:donkey>`) to infer the coefficients for length and girth in a model for a donkey's weight: $ Length ~+ ~ 2 \\times Girth ~-~175 $. \n",
    "In that case study, the model enables vets working in the field to prescribe medication for sick donkeys. \n",
    "And, models can help *describe relationships* and provide insights--for example, in this chapter, we explore relationships between factors correlated with upward mobility, such as commute time, income inequality, and the quality of K-12 education. We carry out a descriptive analysis that follows an analysis social scientists have used to shape public conversation and inform policy recommendations."
