However, the confidence interval is created from one realization of the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution gives us a different probability statement, 95% of the time, an interval constructed in this way will contain $\\theta^*$. Unfortunately, we don't know whether this particular time is one of those that happens 95 times in 100, or not. That is why, the term \"confidence\" is used rather than probability.   \n",
