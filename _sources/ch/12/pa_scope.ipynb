The AQS sensor has the advantage of small measurement error and negligible bias (see {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:data_scope>`). On the other hand, the PurpleAir instrument is less accurate; the measurements have greater variability and we they are also biased.  Our inital question is: Can we use the AQS measurements to make the PurpleAir measurements better?"
