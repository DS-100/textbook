The AQS sensors have the advantage of small measurement error and negligible bias (see {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:scope>`). On the other hand, the PurpleAir instruments are less accurate; the measurements have greater variability and we find they are also biased.  Our question is: Can we use the AQS instruments in some way to improve the PurpleAir measurements?"
