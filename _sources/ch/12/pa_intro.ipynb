    "These sensors are carefully calibrated to strict standards---in fact, the AQS sensors are generally seens as the gold standard for accuracy.\n",

    "First, these sensors are expensive: typically between \\$15,000 and \\$40,000 each.\n",
    "This means that there are fewer sensors, and these sensors are further apart.\n",
    "A person living far away from a sensor might not be able to use these measurements for their personal use.\n",
