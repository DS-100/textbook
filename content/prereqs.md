# Prerequisites

In this book, we assume the reader is comfortable with the knowledge presented
in [Data 8][data8] or some equivalent. In particular, we will assume that the
reader is familiar with the following topics (links to pages from the Data 8
textbook are given in parentheses).

- Tabular data manipulation: selection, filtering, grouping, joining [(link)][8.2]
- Basic probability concepts [(link)][9.5]
- Sampling, empirical distributions of statistics [(link)][10.3]
- Hypothesis testing using bootstrap resampling [(link)][13.4]
- Least squares regression and regression inference [(link)][16.2]
- Classification [(link)][17.1]

In addition, we assume that the reader has taken a course in computer
programming in Python, such as [CS61A][61a] or some equivalent. We will not
explain Python syntax except in special cases.

Finally, we assume that the reader has basic familiarity with partial
derivatives, gradients, vector algebra, and matrix algebra.
