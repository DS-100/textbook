    "The Internet abounds with data that are stored and exchanged in many different formats. In this chapter our aim has been to give you a flavor for the variety of formats available and a basic understanding of how to acquire data from online sources and services. We have also addressed the important goal of acquiring data in a reproducible fashion. Rather than copy-and-paste from a web page or complete a form by hand, we have demonstrated how to write code to acquire data. This code gives you a record of your work flow and of the data provenance. "

    "With each format introduced, we described a model for its structure. A basic understanding of a dataset's organization, helps you uncover issues with quality, mistakes in reading a source file, and how best to wrangle and analyze the data. In the longer run, as you continue to develop your data science skills, you will be exposed to other forms of data exchange, and we expect this approach of considering the organizational model and getting your hands dirty with some simple cases will serve you well.

    "We have only touched the surface of Web services. There are many other useful topics, like keeping connections to a server alive as you issue multiple requests or retrieve data in batches, how to use cookies, and making multiple  connections. But understanding the basics presented here can get you a long way. For example, if you use a library to retrieve data from an API but run into an error, you can start looking at the HTTP requests to debug your code. And, you will know what's possible when a new web service comes online. "

If a site offers a version of the data in a format, like CSV, JSON, or XML, then it's better to download and use these than scrape from from a web page. Likewise, if there is a Python library that provides structured access to a web app, then use it rather than write your own code. When you make requests, start small to test your code, and consider saving the results so you don't have to repeat requests unnecessarily. "
