    "and in this chapter we expand our horizons a bit and introduce a few other popular formats. While CSV, TSV, and FWF files are useful for organizing data into a data frame, other file formats can save space or represent more complex data structures. *Binary* files (binary is a term for formats that aren't plain text) can be more economical than plain text data sources. For example, in this chapter we introduce NetCDF, a popular binary format for exchanging large amounts of scientific data. Other plain text formats like JSON and XML can organize data in ways that are more general and useful for complex data structures. Even HTML Web pages, a close cousin to XML, often contain useful information that we can scrape and wrangle into shape for analysis."

    "In this chapter, we introduce these popular formats, describe a mental model for their organization, and provide examples. In addition to introducing these formats, we cover programmatic ways to acquire data online. Before the Internet, data scientists had to physically move disk drives to share data with one another. Now, we can freely retrieve datasets from computers across the world. We introduce HTTP, the primary communication protocol for the Web, and REST, an architecture to transfer data. By learning a bit about these web technologies, we can take better advantage of the web as a data source."
