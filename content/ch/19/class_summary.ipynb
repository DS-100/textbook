    "In this chapter, we have fitted only simple logistic regressions with one explanatory variable, but we can include other variables in the model. And, if these are categorical, that we include them as one-hot encoded features. These ideas carry over directly from {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:linear>`. The technique of regularization ({numref}`Chapter %s <ch:risk>` also applies to logistic regression. All of these modeling techniques, including using a test-train split to assess the model and cross-validation to choose the threshold are shown in the case study in {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:fake_news>` that develops a model to classify fake news.   \n",

    "Logistic regression is a cornerstone in machine learning. This classification technique can be viewed as a simplified case of a neural network with one layer. When the response variable has more than two categories, logistic regression can be extended to multinomial logistic regression. Another extension for counts is Poisson regression. These different forms of regression are related to maximum likelihood, where the underlying model for the response is binomial, multinomial, or Poisson, respectively, and the goal is to optimize the likelihood of the data over the parameters of the respective distribution. Another name for them is generalized linear models. In all of these scenarios, closed form solutions do not exist, and optimization of the average loss relies on numerical methods. This is the topic of the next chapter.   "
