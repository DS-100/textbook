    "# Theory for Inference and Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to generalize your findings beyond descriptions for your current collection of data to a larger setting, the data needs to be representative of that larger world. For example, you may want to predict air quality at a future time based on a sensor reading ({numref}`Chapter %s <ch:pa>`); test whether an incentive improves the productivity of contributors based on experimental findings ({numref}`Chapter %s <ch:theory_datadesign>`); or construct an interval estimate for the amount of time you spend waiting for a bus ({numref}`Chapter %s <ch:bus>`). We have touched on all of these scenarios in earlier chapters, and now, in this chapter, we formalize the framework for making a prediction or inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of this framework is the notion of a distribution, be it a population, empirical (aka sample), or probability distribution. Understanding the connections between these notions is central to the basics of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, prediction bands, and risk. We begin with a brief review of the urn model, first introduced in {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:theory_datadesign>`, then introduce formal definitions of hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and prediction bands. We use simulation in our examples, including the bootstrap as a special case. We wrap up the chapter with formal definitions of expectation, variance, and standard error, and introduce the varianceâ€“bias decomposition, an essential tool to understanding model selection, regularization, and over fitting, which are topics in {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:regularization>`."
