    "Until the 1980s, randomization tests tended to be limited to comparatively simple kinds of data sets, because there was no general and well-understood method for generating random data sets in more complicated situations.  Computers and related theory have been transcending those limitations during the last two decades, so that randomization tests have grown in importance, and are now used much more often than in the past!\n",

    "There is an extremely important difference that makes this example different from Martin, however.  For the calcium study, the two groups in fact were chosen purely at random.  For the Martin example, there wasn't any actual randomization; instead, random selection was the null model being tested.   For a randomized controlled experiment like the calcium study, the randomization was a deliberate part of the experimental design.  Although the source of the randomization makes no difference in how you calculate the p-value, it makes a tremendous difference in what it tells you.  For Martin, a tiny p-value tells you to reject the null model of random selection.  For the calcium study, that's not a logical option, because the randomization actually occurred.  That randomization guarantees that there are only two possible explanations for the observed difference between the treatment and control groups: chance, or the treatment."
