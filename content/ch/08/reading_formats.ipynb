    "The data from the DAWN survey and the San Francisco restaurant inspections are made available online as plain text files. In order to explore these data, we first need to get them into a `pandas` DataFrame. To do this, we need to know the source file's format and encoding.  For example, a comma-separated-value formatted (CSV) file contains plain text where data values are separated by commas, and records are delimited by newlines (`\"\\n\"` or `\"\\r\\n\"` characters).  CSV files are a natural format for storing data with a table structure: each line in the file corresponds to a row in the table, and the column/feature information in a line are separated by\n",
    "commas. Once we identify the file format, we know how to read it into a Python DataFrame. Other potentially important aspects of the file are its encoding and size. If we don't specify the encoding correctly, then the values in the data frame might contain gibberish, and if the file is huge, then we might not be able to load it into Python. We give an overview of file format and encoding in this section. "

    "A file format describes how data are stored on the computer. This is in contrast to the data's structure, which is a mental representation of our data.  The mental model for structure helps us  interact with and analyse the data. For example, a table representation corresponds to data values arranged in rows and columns, and when we work with these data we think about transforming columns, aggregating rows, and cleaning values. On the other hand, understanding how the raw data is stored on the computer (the source file) helps us figure out how to read the data into Python and work with it as a data frame. In this section, we introduce several popular formats used to store data tables as plain text."
