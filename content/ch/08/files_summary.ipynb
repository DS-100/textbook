    "Data wrangling is an essential part of data analysis. Without it, we risk overlooking problems in data that can have major consequences for future analysis. This chapter covered an important first step in data wrangling: reading data from a plain-text source file into a Python dataframe and identifying its granularity. We introduced different types of file formats and encodings, and we wrote code that can read data from these formats. We checked the size of source files and considered alternative tools for working with large datasets. "

    "Understanding the shape and granularity of a table gives us insight into what a row in a data table represents. This helps us determine whether the granularity is mixed, aggregation is needed, or weights are required. After looking at the granularity of your dataset, you should have answers to the following questions:"

    "- *What does a record represent?* Clarity on this will help you correctly carry out a data analysis and state your findings. \n",
    "- *Do all records in a table capture granularity at the same level?* Sometimes a table contains additional summary rows that have a different granularity, and you want to use only those rows that are at the right level of detail.  \n",
