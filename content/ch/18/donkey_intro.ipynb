    "In this case study, we follow the work of [Kate Milner and Jonathan Rougier](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2014.00768.x) to create a model that veterinarians in the Kenyan countryside can use to make accurate estimates of a donkey's weight.  \n",
    "As usual, we walk through the steps of the data science lifecycle, but this time our work departs from the basics covered so far in this book. You can think of this case study as an opportunity to reflect on many of the core principles of working with data and understand how they can be extended to address the context of the situation. We directly evaluate sources of measurement error, design a special loss function that reflects the concern about an overdose, build a model while keeping applicability utmost in mind, and evaluate model predictions using special criterion that are relative to the donkey's size.
