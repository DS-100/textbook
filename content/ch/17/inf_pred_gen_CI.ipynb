These examples are point estimates for unknown values, called *parameters*: the median lateness of the bus is 0.74 minutes; the humidity adjustment to air quality is 0.21 PM2.5 per humidity percentage point; and the ratio of COVID infection rates in  vaccine efficacy is 0.67. However, a different sample would have produced a different estimate. Simply providing a point estimate doesn't give a sense of the estimate's precision. Alternatively, an interval estimate can reflect the estimate's accuracy. These intervals typically take one of two forms:\n",

Since the null model did not completely specify the data generation mechanism, we resorted to bootstrapping. That is, we used the data as the population, took a sample of 11,226 records with replacement from the bootstrap population, and fitted the model to find the bootstrap sample coefficient for humidity. Our simulation repeated this process 10,000 times, to get an approximate bootstrap sampling distribution."

If, say a 95% confidence interval contains the hypothesized value $\\theta^*$, then the $p$-value for the test is less than 5%.

We used this technique in the previous section when we carried out the test that the coefficient for humidity in the air quality model is 0. In this section, we have created a 99% confidence interval for the coefficient (based on the bootstrap percentiles) and since 0 does not belong to the interval, the $p$-value is less than 1% and statistical logic would lead us to conclude that the coefficient is not 0.
