    "It can be tempting to throw all of the variables available to us into a model to get the \"best fit possible\". But, we should keep in mind the geometry of least squares when fitting models. Recall, that $p$ explanatory variables can be thought of as $p$ vectors in $n$-dimensional space, and if these vectors are highly correlated, then the projections onto this space will be similar to projections onto smaller spaces made up of fewer vectors.
