    "In this chapter, we extend the basic modeling process introduced in {numref}`Chapter %s <ch:modeling>`, to the design of *linear models*. These seemingly simple models are capable of expressing complex non-linear relationships between variables, can be made robust to noisy data, and applied to problems at scale.  Linear models, are a key building block in many other more advanced modeling techniques including artificial neural networks and deep learning. But perhaps more critically, linear models are a powerful tool for generalization.  They allow us to make predictions and in some cases gain insights into the underlying phenomena that generated the data.  "
