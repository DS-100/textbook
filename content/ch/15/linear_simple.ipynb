    "Like with the constant model, our goal is to approximate the signal in a feature by a constant. Now, we have additional information from a second feature to help us. In short, we want to use information from a second feature to make a better model than the constant model.  For example, we might describe the sale price of a house by its size, or predict a donkey's weight from its length. In each of these examples, we have an *outcome* feature (sale price, weight) that we want to explain, describe, or predict with the help of an *explanatory* feature (house size, length). \n",
