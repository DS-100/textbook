    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are used to search for patterns in strings. (The pattern is called the *regular expression* or *regex* for short.) To make this notion more concrete, think about the format of social-security numbers (SSN). If you were asked to describe it, you might say that SSNs consist of three digits, then a dash, two digits, another dash, then four digits. The SSN is an example of a formal language, meaning it consists of strings that are described by a regular expression. In our example, any SSN can be described by the following regular expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we haven't yet introduced the syntax and special characters associated with regular expressions, or even how to \"parse\" them, you can probably make sense of the pattern above. It follows closely the written description of a SSN that we just gave. While cryptic at a first glance, the syntax of regular expressions is fortunately quite simple to learn; we introduce nearly all of the syntax in this section alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we introduce the concepts, we tackle some of the examples described in an earlier section, and show how to carry out the tasks with regular expressions.  Almost all programming languages have a library to match patterns using regular expressions, making regular expressions useful regardless of the specific programming language. We use some of the common methods available in the Python built-in `re` module to accomplish the tasks from the examples. These methods are summarized in a table at the end of this section, where the basic usage and return value are briefly described. Since we only cover a few of the most commonly used methods, you may find it useful to consult [the official documentation on the `re` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) as well."
