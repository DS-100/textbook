    "As with most types of data, there are a multitude of techniques for working with text to address these challenges. In this chapter, we introduce a few of these techniques. We show how simple string manipulation tools are often all we need to put text in a standard form or extract portions of strings. We also introduce regular expressions for more general and robust pattern matching that may be needed to search for patterns in strings and perform document analysis. To make these text operations more concrete, we begin by introducing several examples that need string manipulations or regular expressions to prepare text for analysis. "
