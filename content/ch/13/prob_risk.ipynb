We selected a constant model and minimized the mean squared error (MSE) loss function on this dataset, guaranteeing that our constant model outperforms all other constant models on this dataset and loss function. The constant model has a single parameter, $ \\theta $. We found that the optimizing parameter $ \\hat{\\theta} = \\text{mean}(\\textbf y) $ for the MSE loss.\n",

Using this notation, the risk $ R(\\theta) $ of our model is:\n",

    "Unlike loss alone, using risk allows us to reason about the model's accuracy on the population in general. If our model achieves a low risk, our model will make accurate predictions on points from the population in the long term. On the other hand, if our model has a high risk it will in general perform poorly on data from the population.\n",

We use the variable $ \\theta^* $ to represent the risk-minimizing value of $ \\theta $, or the optimal model parameter for the population. To clarify, $ \\theta^* $ represents the model parameter that minimizes risk while $ \\hat{\\theta} $ represents the parameter that minimizes dataset-specific loss."
