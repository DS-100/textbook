    "# Target Population, Access Frame, Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "An important initial step in the data life cycle is to express the question of interest in the context of the subject area and consider the connection between the question and the data collected to answer that question.  It’s good practice to do this before even thinking about the analysis or modelling steps because it may uncover a disconnect where the question of interest cannot be directly addressed with these data. As part of making the connection between the data collection process and the topic of investigation, we identify the population, the means of accessing the population, instruments of measurement, and additional protocols used in the collection process. These concepts help us understand the scope of the data, whether we aim to gain knowledge about a population, scientific quantity, physical model, social behavior, etc.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The *target population* consists of the collection of elements that you ultimately intend to describe and draw conclusions about. By *element* we mean those individuals that make up our population. The element may be a person in a group of people, a voter in an election, a tweet from a collection of tweets, or a county in a state. We sometimes call an element a *unit* or an *atom*.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The *access frame* is the collection of elements that are accessible to you for measurement and observation. These are the units by which you can access the target population. Ideally, the frame and population are perfectly aligned; meaning they consist of the exact same elements. However, the units in an access frame may be only a subset of the target population; additionally, the frame may include units that don’t belong to the population. For example, to find out how a voter intends to vote in an election, you might call people by phone. Someone you call, may not be a voter so they are in your frame but not in the poulation. On the other hand, a voter who never answers a call from an unkown number can't be reached so they are in the population but not in your frame.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The *sample* is the subset of units taken from the access frame to measure, observe, and analyze. The sample gives you the data to analyze to make predictions or generalizations about the population of interest.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of the access frame, in comparison to the target population, and the method used to select units from the frame to be in the sample are important factors in determining whether or not the data can be considered representative of the target population.  If the access frame is not representative of the target population, then the data from the sample is most likely not representative either. And, if the units are sampled in a biased manner, problems with representativeness also arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following examples, we provide a diagram for the data scope. The target population, access frame, and sample are represented by circles with shaded interior, and for each example, the configuration of their overlap represents the scope.  \n"

    "Content on Wikipedia is written and edited by volunteers who belong to the Wikipedia community. This online community is crucial to the success and vitality of Wikipedia. In trying to understand how to incentivize members of online communities, researchers carried out an experiment with Wikipedia contributors as subjects {cite}`restivo2012`. The target population is the collection of active contributors—those who made at least one contribution to Wikipedia in the month before the start of the study. Additionally, the target population was further restricted to the top 1% of contributors.  The access frame eliminated anyone in the population who had received an informal incentive that month. The access frame purposely excluded some of the contributors in the population because the researchers want to measure the impact of an incentive and those who had already received one incentive might behave differently.

Selecting top contributors from among this group limits the generalizability of the findings, but given the size of the group of top contributors, if they can be influenced by an informal reward to maintain or increase their contributions that is a valuable finding. \n",

Political polling is a type of public opinion survey held prior to an election that attempts to gauge who people will vote for.

Additionally, the techniques for drawing the sample can impact how representative of the population the sample is. We begin to address this topic  in {numref}`sec:variationtypes`.  When you think about the generalizability of your data findings, you will also want to consider the quality of the instruments and procedures used to collect the data.

    "When we consider the scope of the data, we also consider the instrument being used to take the measurements and the the procedure for taking measurement, which we call the *protocol*. For a survey, the instrument is typically the questionnaire that an individual in the sample answers. The protocol for a survey includes how the sample is chosen, how nonrespondents are followed up, interviewer training, protections for confidentiality, etc. \n",

If we want to measure a natural phenomenon, such as the speed of light, we need to quantify the accuracy of the instrument. The protocol for calibrating the instrument and taking measurements is also vital to obtaining accurate measurements. Instruments can go out of alignment and measurements can drift over time leading to poor, highly inaccurate measurements (see {numref}`sec:variationtypes`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Protocols are also critical in experiments. Ideally, any factor that can influence the outcome of the experiment is controlled.

(This unkown value referred is often referred to as a *parameter*.) In our diagram, we shrink the target to a point that represents this unknown. The instrument’s accuracy acts as the frame, and the sample consists of the measurements taken by the instrument within the frame. You might think of the frame as a dart board, where the instrument is the person throwing the darts. If they are reasonably good, the darts land within the circle, scattered around the bullseye. The scatter of darts correspond to the measurments taken by the instrument. The target point is not seen by the dart thrower, but ideally it coincides with the bullseye. \n",
