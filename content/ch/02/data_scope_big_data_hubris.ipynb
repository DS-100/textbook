For example, data journalists look for interesting stories in data much like how traditional beat reporters hunt for news stories.

Researchers can link data collected from scientific studies with, say, medical data that have been collected for healthcare purposes; these administrative data that have been collected for reasons that don't directly stem from the question of interest can be useful in other settings. Such linkages can help data scientists expand the possibilities of their analyses and cross-check the quality of their data. In addition, found data can include digital traces, such as your web-browsing activity, posts on social media, and online network of friends and acquaintances, and can be quite complex. "

Despite initial success, in the 2011–2012 flu season, Google's data scientists found that GFT was not a substitute for the more traditional surveillance reports of three-week old counts collected by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from laboratories across the United States. In comparison, GFT overestimated the CDC numbers for 100 out of 108 weeks (see {numref}`Figure %s <fig:GFTseries>`). Week after week, GFT came in too high for the cases of influenza, even though it was based on big data. \n",

    "Data scientists found that a simple model built from past CDC reports that used 3-week-old CDC data and seasonal trends did a better job of predicting flu prevalence than GFT. The GFT overlooked considerable information that can be extracted by basic statistical methods. This does not mean that big data captured from online activity is useless. In fact, researchers have shown that the combination of GFT data with CDC data can substantially improve on both GFT predictions and the CDC-based model[^Lazer15]. It is often the case that combining different approaches leads to improvements over individual methods."
