This simulation study imitates drawing more than a thousand marbles (voters who participate in the poll) from an urn of six million. We can examine potential sources of bias and the variation in the polling results, and carry out a what-if analysis, where we examine how the predictions might have gone if even a larger number of draws from the urn were taken.
