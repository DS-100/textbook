# Additional Material

Collected here are a variety of resources for a more in-depth treatment of the larger themes in this book. In addition to recommendations for these broad topics, we provide a list of resources for several smaller topics and big topics that we only lightly touched on. These resources are organized in the order in which the topics appear in the book.
