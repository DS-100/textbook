# Additional Material 

We cover a lot of topics in this book, and if you want to learn more about them, we have collected a list of additional resources that include textbooks and online tutorials. 

More in-depth treatments of the larger themes in this book can be found in the following resources.

+ The sampling topics introduced in this book and several more, can be found in [*Sampling: Design and Analysis*](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429298899) by Lohr. Lohr also contains a treatment of the population, access frame, sampling methods, and sources of bias.  

+ For an introductory treatment of the urn model, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests, we recommend [*Statistics*](https://wwnorton.com/books/Statistics/) by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves.

+ A more mathematical treatment of probability that is still introductory we suggest [*Probability*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-4374-8) by Pitman and [*Introduction to Probability*](https://doi.org/10.1201/b17221) by Hwang and Blitzstein.

+ A resource for data wrangling is [*Principles of Data Wrangling: Practical Techniques for Data Preparation*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/principles-of-data/9781491938911/) by Rattenbury, Hellerstein, Heer, Kandel, and Carreras. Many of the organizational topics of wrangling stem from this resource. 

+ [* *]() by for Pandas

+  SQL [*The Essence of Databases*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/274800) by Roland. W3 School [Introduction to SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp)

+ The original test by Tukey,[*Exploratory Data Analysis*](https://archive.org/details/exploratorydataa00tuke_0) offers an introduction to the topic. A more modern treatment can be found in XXXX.

+ See [*Fundamentals of Data Visualization: A Primer on Making Informative and Compelling Figures*](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) by Wilke for more on visualization. Our guidelines do not entirely match Wilke's but they come close and it's helpful to see a variety of opinions on the topic.

+ The many topics on modeling, including transformations, one-hot encoding, model-selection, cross-validation, and regularization can be found in several sources. We recommend: [*Linear Models with Python*](https://julianfaraway.github.io/LMP/) by Faraway, [*Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/applied-regression-analysis-and-generalized-linear-models/book237254) by Fox, [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in Python*](https://www.statlearning.com/) by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor, and [*Applied Linear Regression*](https://doi.org/10.1002/0471704091) by Weisberg.  

+ A more formal treatment of confidence intervals, prediction intervals, testing, and the bootstrap can be found in [*Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis*](https://www.cengage.com/c/mathematical-statistics-and-data-analysis-3e-rice/9780534399429/).

+ Owen's online text, [*Monte Carlo theory, methods and examples*](https://artowen.su.domains/mc/) provides a solid introduction to simulation.

+ [*Programming Collective Intelligence*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-collective-intelligence/9780596529321/) by Segaran covers the topic of optimization.

+ See [*Applied Text Analysis with Python: Enabling Language-Aware Data Products with Machine Learning*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-text-analysis/9781491963036/) by Bengfort, Bilbro, and Ojeda for more on text analysis.
