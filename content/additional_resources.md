We cover a lot of topics in this book, and if you want to learn more about any of them, we have collected a list of additional resources, including textbooks and online tutorials. 

For an overview of the larger themes in this book see:

+ [*Statistics*](https://wwnorton.com/books/Statistics/) by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves is useful for introductory statistics related to the urn model;

+ [*Probability*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-4374-8) by Pitman and [*Introduction to Probaqbility*](https://doi.org/10.1201/b17221) by Hwang and Blitzstein for a more mathematical treatment of probability;

+ [*Principles of Data Wrangling: Practical Techniques for Data Preparation*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/principles-of-data/9781491938911/) by Rattenbury, Hellerstein, Heer, Kandel, and Carreras for more on data wrangling; 

+ [* *]() by for Pandas

+ [*Monte Carlo theory, methods and examples*](https://artowen.su.domains/mc/) by Owen to learn more about simulation;

+ [*Programming Collective Intelligence*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-collective-intelligence/9780596529321/) by Segaran for more on optimization.

+ [*Applied Text Analysis with Python: Enabling Language-Aware Data Products with Machine Learning*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-text-analysis/9781491963036/) by Bengfort, Bilbro, and Ojeda for more on text analysis.

In addition, we provide a list of references for several smaller topics and topics that were lightly touched upon. 

+ To learn more about the interplay between questions and data, we recommend [Questions, Answers, and Statistics](https://iase-web.org/documents/papers/icots2/Speed.pdf) by Speed. 

+ To learn more about how to analyze data with a time domain, we refer you to [*Time Series Analysis and Its Applications*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-52452-8) by Shumway and Stoffer.

+ Ethics

+ A proof that the median minimizes absolute error can be found in [*Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics Volume I*](https://www.routledge.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Basic-Ideas-and-Selected-Topics-Volume-I-Second/Bickel-Doksum/p/book/9781498723800) by  Bickel and Doksum. 

+ For more information about how to handle missing data, see [*Statistical Analysis with Missing Data*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Statistical+Analysis+with+Missing+Data,+3rd+Edition-p-9780470526798) by Little and Rubin.

+ The smooth density curve is covered in greater detail in [*Density Estimation for Statistics and Data Analysis*](https://www.routledge.com/Density-Estimation-for-Statistics-and-Data-Analysis/Silverman/p/book/9780412246203) by Silverman. 

+ For more information on color palettes see Brewer's [ColorBrewer2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/).

+ See [Statistical Calibration: A Review](https://doi.org/10.2307/1403690) by Osborne for more on calibration. 

+ Chapter 10 in Fox gives an informative treatment of vector geometry of least squares.

+ Chapter 14 in Fox covers the maximum likelihood approach to logistic regression. 

+ Chapter 4 in James et al covers sensitivity and specificity in more detail.
