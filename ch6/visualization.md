# Data Visualization

Data visualization is an essential tool for data science at every step of
analysis, from data cleaning to EDA to communicating conclusions and
predictions. Because human minds are highly developed for visual perception, a
well-chosen plot can often reveal trends and anolmalies in the data much faster
than a textual description.

In this chapter, we introduce the most useful visualizations for data analysis
and when to use each one. We also explain how to spot misleading visualizations
and how to improve visualizations using data tranformations, smoothing, and
dimensionality reduction.
