<h1 id="Regularization">Regularization<a class="anchor-link" href="#Regularization"> </a></h1><p>Feature engineering can incorporate important information about the data
generation process into our model. However, adding features to the data also
typically increases the variance of our model and can thus result in worse
performance overall. Rather than throwing out features entirely, we can turn to
a technique called regularization to reduce the variance of our model while
still incorporating as much information about the data as possible.</p>
