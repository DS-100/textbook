<h1 id="Classification">Classification<a class="anchor-link" href="#Classification"> </a></h1><p>Thus far we have studied models for regression, the process of making
continuous, numerical estimations based on data. We now turn our attention to
<strong>classification</strong>, the process of making categorical predictions based on
data. For example, weather stations are interested in predicting whether
tomorrow will be rainy or not using the weather conditions today.</p>
<p>Together, regression and classification compose the primary approaches for
<em>supervised learning</em>, the general task of learning a model based on observed
input-output pairs.</p>
<p>We may reconstruct classification as a type of regression problem. Instead of
creating a model to predict an arbitrary number, we create a model to predict a
probability that a data point belongs to a category. This allows us to reuse
the machinery of linear regression for a regression on probabilities: logistic
regression.</p>
