<h1 id="Working-with-Text">Working with Text<a class="anchor-link" href="#Working-with-Text"> </a></h1><p>A great quantity of data resides not as numbers in CSVs but as free-form text
in books, documents, blog posts, and Internet comments. While numerical and
categorical data are often collected from physical phenomena, textual data
arises from human communication and expression. As with most types of data,
there are a multitude of techniques for working with text that would take
multiple books to explain in full detail. In this chapter, we introduce a small
subset of these techniques that provide a variety of useful operations for
working with text: Python string manipulation and regular expressions.</p>
