# About This Book

Before we continue, it is important for us to state our assumptions about the
reader.

In this book, we will proceed as though you have taken [Data 8][data8] or some
equivalent. In particular, we will assume that you have some familiarity with
the following topics (links to pages from the Data 8 textbook are given in
parentheses).

- Tabular data manipulation: selection, filtering, grouping, joining [(link)](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/07/2/classifying-by-one-variable.html)
- Sampling, empirical distributions of statistics [(link)](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/09/3/empirical-distribution-of-a-statistic.html)
- Hypothesis testing using bootstrap resampling [(link)](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/4/using-confidence-intervals.html)
- Least squares regression and regression inference [(link)](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/2/inference-for-the-true-slope.html)
- Classification [(link)](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/15/1/nearest-neighbors.html)

In addition, we will assume that you have taken [CS61A][61a] or some equivalent
and thus will not explain Python syntax except in special cases.
