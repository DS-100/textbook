/**
 * The website contains two main components: the sidebar and the textbook page.
 * This file specifies the layout and includes classes to show/hide the sidebar
 * on small screens.
 *
 * The actual styling for the sidebar and page are located in their respective
 * component SCSS files. This file manages the layout and width only.
 *
 * By default, the sidebar is not visible.
 *
 * [1]: The entire page is positioned relative so that when the page overflows
 *   (e.g. sidebar open on small screens) the user can't scroll left/right.
 * [2]: The sidebar and the textbook page are positioned absolute so that we
 *   can use translate() on the textbook page to reveal the sidebar.
 * [3]: Setting the background color hides the sidebar when it's behind the
 *   page (otherwise the page is transparent).
 *
 * When the sidebar is visible:
 *
 * [4]: Shift the textbook page over to the left. On small screens, the page
 *   will overflow since the sidebar takes up most of the screen.
 * [5]: On larger screens, the page and sidebar have enough room to read them
 *   simultaneously, so make sure that the page doesn't overflow.
