    "\n",
    "So far we have discussed binary classification, in which our classifier determines whether an observation is part of the positive class or the negative class. However, many data science problems involve **multiclass classification**, in which we would like to classify observations as one of several different classes. For example, we may be interested in knowing whether an animal is a dog, a cat, a squirrel, or a raccoon. In practice, we use **one-vs-rest (OvR) classification** to solve these types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-Vs-Rest Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In OvR classification (also known as one-vs-all, or OvA), we decompose a multiclass classification problem into several different binary classification problems. Returning to the example of animal identification, each observation $X_i$ in the training data would be assigned a label $y_i$ that classifies the animal as either a dog, a cat, a squirrel, or a raccoon. Then for each unique label $k$, we construct a new label vector $z$ where $z=1$ if $y=k$ and $z=0$ if $y \\neq k$. With our four new label vectors, we can then create four separate classification tasks that predicts whether an observation belongs to the positive class. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far in binary classification, we have used the output of these predictors - for example, we were primarily interested in whether the observation was a dog or not a dog. However, in multiclass classification we use the probabilities that each classifier outputs, then we assign the label $k$ for which the respective classifier outputs the highest probability score. Suppose the four classifiers output the probability scores shown below:"
