    "- What is multiclass classification\n",
    "    - More than 2 labels that can be classified; versus a binary classification which is restricted to 2 labels\n",
    "- A situation where multiclass classification might be used\n",
    "    - Preferably come up with an example in lebron.csv, but might have to use a different data set\n",
    "- OvO vs OvR\n",
    "    - In logistic regression, multiclass classification comes down to a bunch of binary problems\n",
    "    - OvO: Fit a binary classification problem to each pair of classes, then vote for class that wins the most \"head-to-head\" classifications\n",
    "    - OvR/OvA: Fit a binary classification problem for each class versus the rest of the classes; result is class that has the highest probability\n",
    "- Example walking through multiclass? sklearn's logistic regression supports OvR out of the box.\n",
