We can compute a similar probability distribution for each value of $ x $ that appears in our data. Naturally, after fitting a logistic model we would like the distribution predicted by the model to be as close as possible to the empirical distribution from the dataset.

    "The cross-entropy loss also has fundamental underpinnings in statistics. Since the logistic regression model predicts probabilities, given a particular logistic model we can ask, \"What is the probability that this model produced the set of observed outcomes $ \\boldsymbol{y} $?\" We might naturally adjust the parameters of our model until the probability of drawing our dataset from the model is as high as possible. Although we will not prove it in this section, this procedure is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy loss—this is the *maximum likelihood* statistical justification for the cross-entropy loss.\n",

Minimizing average KL divergence also minimizes average cross-entropy loss. We can reduce the divergence of logistic regression models by selecting parameters that accurately classify commonly occurring data."
