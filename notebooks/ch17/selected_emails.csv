 Hi Folks,
 
 I've been trying to set a button called which automatically
 forwards mail using a '-form mycomps' without going through
 the editor, but so far haven't got the right recipe.
 
 I currently have in my .exmh-defaults:
 
 *Mops.spam.text:        Spam
 *Mops.spam.command:     Msg_Forward -form spamcomps -noedit -nowhatnowproc ; Msg
 _Remove
 
 
 I've also tried with ""SeditSend {$draft $t 0}"" after the forward command.
 It should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then
 delete.  It does so, but not without producing the edit window.
 
 Any help appreciated.

 Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend
 
 August 25, 2002
 By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when
 he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways
 last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner
 and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and
 renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped
 through his files and found the number for the Texas
 Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David
 Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation
 for fixing problem companies. 
 
 Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,
 had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of
 $66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed
 for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600
 million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in
 America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. 
 
 That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let
 Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked
 Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.
 Siegel reached. 
 
 In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days
 before US Airways announced its plans to file for
 bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated
 about $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas
 Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to
 kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep
 the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to
 buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,
 and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges
 from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a
 better offer. 
 
 ""One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks
 were,"" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in
 an interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""There aren't
 many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to
 delve into the airline industry."" 
 
 Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying
 businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman
 made their names during the recession of the early 1990's
 with investments in Continental and America West. The
 firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping
 companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its
 extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. 
 
 Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last
 year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six
 acquisitions, most in unloved industries like
 semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,
 it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been
 losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding
 for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. 
 
 The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these
 deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of
 MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6
 - yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150
 million bank loan. 
 
 In the last few years, most firms that specialize in
 leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and
 other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -
 have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made
 managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are
 for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. 
 
 Texas Pacific is different. ""This is a terrific environment
 for them,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the
 Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. 
 
 Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the
 West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: ""Most
 other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.
 You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational
 fixes."" 
 
 Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep
 its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant
 interviews and its Web site is perpetually under
 construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,
 the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for
 this article. 
 
 Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and
 bright, patterned socks. ""He likes argyle socks, and they
 tend to fall down around his ankles,"" said Henry Miller, an
 investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in
 his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman
 argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. 
 
 When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known
 for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking
 in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.
 ""Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on
 my caller I.D., I know it's David calling,"" said one
 investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. 
 
 Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the
 chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.
 Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making
 early bets in industries like cable television and taking
 stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,
 which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a
 decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual
 return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. 
 
 In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.
 Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also
 worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with
 Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &
 Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. 
 
 The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers
 and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master
 strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and
 the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price
 often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. 
 
 ""David is very much the optimist, very much the deal
 maker,"" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of
 Continental. ""Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.
 He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will
 approach investments a little bit more skeptically than
 David does."" 
 
 By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well
 established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion
 from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To
 celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San
 Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a
 party. 
 
 But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific
 hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no
 deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate
 blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but
 stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the
 businesses untenable. 
 
 Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing
 investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during
 that stretch. 
 
 ""They started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said Mario
 Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money
 management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific
 investors. 
 
 The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas
 Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that
 needed its help. 
 
 But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the
 rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health
 maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the
 mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new
 managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a
 $280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian
 motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than
 quadrupled. 
 
 But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at
 the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million
 investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for
 which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,
 has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of
 Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand
 for luxury goods. 
 
 Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a
 semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,
 both of which filed for bankruptcy. 
 
 Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's
 performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in
 two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The
 first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and
 including investments made through March 1997, should
 return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific
 investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997
 - could return less than half that, this investor
 estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on
 these investments before the stock market sank. 
 
 But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings
 in the second fund, profits on these investments could
 rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new
 management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the
 economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, ""their
 returns look pretty good when you consider that some other
 funds won't return any capital"" to investors. 
 
 But with the weak economy throwing many companies into
 trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier
 success, the investor said. ""They should do exceptionally
 well,"" he said. 
 
 Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It
 relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure
 troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except
 for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it
 replaces managers. 
 
 Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,
 for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his
 old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it
 to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. 
 
 Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then
 brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and
 in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief
 executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul
 of the company and is now considered a great turnaround
 artist of the industry. 
 
 ""The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob
 Ferguson,"" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for
 the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the
 thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982
 Braniff bankruptcy. ""He chose Bethune over his longtime
 friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a
 better job."" 
 
 At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more
 extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was
 led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. 
 
 W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.
 Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of
 chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.
 Parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhat
 kindred spirits."" 
 
 The board replaced most senior managers at America West,
 except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped
 down last September. His restructuring plan had made the
 airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from
 bankruptcy in August 1994. 
 
 Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth
 about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and
 the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. 
 
 ""These are not passive investors, nor am I,"" said Donald L.
 Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's
 board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. ""You're active.
 Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."" 
 
 After overseeing managers who worked successfully with
 unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a
 good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways
 was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris
 Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. 
 
 Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as labor
 friendly as possible,"" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can
 still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the
 billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed
 interest. 
 
 Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with
 Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two
 years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the
 chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had
 been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for
 sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National
 Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King
 franchisees. 
 
 ""We liked what they had to say about the human component of
 the businesses they buy,"" Mr. Josephson said. Many other
 owners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" 
 
 At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an
 executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John
 Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,
 who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest
 bought out their stake in Continental in 1998. 
 
 Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored
 with the technology industry, despite the failure of so
 many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the
 semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is
 highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. 
 
 The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,
 which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,
 has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and
 took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of
 its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger
 investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip
 maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in
 Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for
 bankruptcy last year. 
 
 Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third
 company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6
 billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last
 year. 
 
 Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,
 may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the
 payment to E.On, based in Dsseldorf, Germany, was actually
 more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal
 said. 
 
 Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company
 of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to
 guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas
 Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of
 which it swapped for more stock in the company. 
 
 ""They did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" said
 Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted
 that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit
 since the fourth quarter of 2000. 
 
 But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly
 sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America
 West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,
 the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. 
 
 Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount
 ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75
 million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to
 invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.
 Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as
 Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site
 but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until
 after the sale. 
 
 The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt
 Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that
 the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific
 remains committed to it. 
 
 Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to
 talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman
 seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the
 steep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,
 Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,
 Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet.

 No, they do not (what would be the use of that, anyway?). They say that

 More detail please?  I do use sequences, so I'm familiar with their

 You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on
 a very remote machine.  In this scenario, the mime handling is weak.

 This works when you are defining a switch that %configure
 does not already define, but how can we override an
 existing switch?  For example,
 
   prefix: /usr/local
 
   %configure --prefix=%{?_prefix:%{prefix}}
 
 would be desirable for making a .rpm package relocatable,
 but this doesn't work.  'configure' receives two switches,
 the default '--prefix=/usr' and the (attempted) override
 '--prefix=/usr/local', but it only recognizes the first one.

 1)  I think the code is still very much pre-beta.
 
 2)  When you go to the ""Download"" page, it tells you ""Fetch the latest
 versions of razor-agents and razor-agents-sdk packages""  It is not at all
 clear that these are development packages.
 
 The site is badly designed, and very misleading.  IMO.  The fact that the
 word ""beta"" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front
 page is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design ""fact"":
 USERS DON'T READ *ANYTHING*)
 
 I get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead
 users into downloading the dev code in order to get more unwitting test
 sites.
 
 But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

 By far the coolest solution to this would be to ""fix"" php :)
 Take a look at main/php_variables.c in the php source distribution.
 You could mess around with the variable is_array in
 php_register_variable_ex() and see if you can force all variables to be
 arrays :) As far as I can tell the reason they do this is to save
 time by not having to work out which variables have multiple values.

 Odd. Did I certify that one? What's the 7-digit IBM model number, and
 which version of Red Hat were you running?

 Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
 immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: ""I'll often
 find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
 entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
 common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
 Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
 You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
 the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
 Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
 Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
 it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
 wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
 that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
 folder as the download)."" Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
 shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
 get cranky.
 
 <p>
 
 And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
 Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
 <a href=""http://www.jv16.org/"">jv16.org</a>. The program is called
 jv16 Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
 combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
 manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
 the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
 Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
 consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
 development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
 Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
 corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
 use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
 forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
 I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
 Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition.""
 Consider this a huge nod!
 
 <p>
 
 I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
 United Kingdom has one for us, too: ""As a dedicated subscriber, I
 just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
 trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
 advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
 problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
 advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
 as well. Check out <a href=""http://www.commercialbreaksandbeats.co.uk/"">Commercial
 Breaks and Beats</a>. I have no connection with it; I'm just
 grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.
 If you check the message board on the site, you'll see that I'm
 not alone."" This <a href=""http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Television/Commercials/"">Google
 Directory</a> can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I
 almost fell out of my chair the other day when I heard ""Yeh Yeh""
 (by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler advertisement. Way to go:
 John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids love to bite.
 
 <p>
 
 And what's say we round out the report with another tip?
 Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: ""The e-mail forwarding
 service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
 Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
 your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
 Then, select Tools | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
 the message is from specified account' in the first section.
 'Reply with message"" in section two. Select the appropriate
 account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
 have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
 to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
 has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
 sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway."" True! So,
 what rule simplifies your day?

 {Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! ""QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments."" You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!

 {Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. ""For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games."" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!

To summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem ISN'T!

 {Answering machine} ""Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID."" Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, ""I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!"" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

 <p>
 After surfing serious Web site upon serious Web site, you just need to find a site where you can relax and have a good time. TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week ""Steve Schneider Interviews Himself""). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat. Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason. Worst-case scenario, you can always sign up for their current promotion... free linguine!

 This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. ""The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions."" To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any ""idle tasks."" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. ""All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks."" Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.

18,"This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and 
 mh.
 
 Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail 
 server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that 
 facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the 
 stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to 
 rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is 
 unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the 
 spool.
 
 I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:
 
 1)  Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.  This 
 means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "".  Any such line will 
 look like "">From "".
 
 2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"".  When I was 
 having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, 
 then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but 
 you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.
 
 3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
 letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the 
 whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and 
 everything works.

 0. INTRO.  [IBM DB2]
 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY.
 2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE.
 3. BE A SF.NET FOUNDRY GUIDE.
 4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
 5. SITE STATISTICS
 
 
 0. INTRO
 
 Hello SourceForge.net Users,
 
 This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
 large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
 the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
 These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
 management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
 dependent website.
 
 Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
 a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
 the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
 70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
 growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
 the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
 press release here:
 
 http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html
 
 How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
 difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
 SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
 phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
 the databases advanced capabilities.
 
 Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
 site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.
 
 If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
 please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
 appreciate the feedback.
 
 Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
 Open Source Community.
 
 Pat-
 
 Patrick McGovern
 Director, SourceForge.net
 
 
 
 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY
 
 SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
 is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
 ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
 community can always obtain the software released by hosted
 projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
 download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
 as to provide better download times regardless of which network
 provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.
 
 Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
 further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
 additions include servers hosted by:
 
 Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
 http://www.twtelecom.com/
 
 University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
 http://www.umn.edu/
 
 CESNET (Czech Republic)
 http://www.cesnet.cz/
 
 We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
 the needs of the Open Source community.
 
 On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
 an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
 SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
 know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net
 
 
 
 2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE

 3. CONTRIBUTE TO SOURCEFORGE.NET! BE A FOUNDRY GUIDE!
 
 Want to contribute to SourceForge.net, but you don't know how to
 code? Be a foundry guide!  Foundry guides get to hype the cool
 projects that they think are worth downloading and testing.
 A guide finds all the stuff on the web about their subject of
 choice, and gives it prominent placement.  How do you become a
 foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a
 topic that interests you; and send email to
 foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you
 are qualified to be a foundry guide.

 hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6

 Hi, 
    I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
 unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
 from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
 executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
 problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
 to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?
 
 Thanks

 It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
 only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
 What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
 still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
 executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
 government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
 officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
 and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
 Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
 from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
 can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
 the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
 it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
 this may hold true for other European countries as well.  
 
 After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
 thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.

 probably there are more elegant solutions, but if your zips are in one

 for i in *.zip
 do
 if unzip -v $i | grep -q FILEYOUWANT
 then

 Funny, I was in the middle of composing the same message when I saw yours.
 
 It would be nice if it sees a header like:
 Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
 
 and defang_mime is 0, it could wrap the report with <pre></pre> for ease
 of reading?
 
 And the same sort of problem seems to occur with base64 encoded messages.
 The report is placed inside of the mime boundary:

 When you can hold and sponsor a giant restrictive device (using giant
 restrictorism principles, then,) conference/exhibition and get 30 invited
 exhibitors, with lecturedemos, on elastic polity, concepts of public
 responsibility have gone rather far off theory into quartering.
 
 The way I reckon it, they plan on fixing the seats/plane and security
 problem by further sectioning airplanes:
 	1- Checked luggage
 	2- Calcium formerly in passengers and crew
 	3- The rest of the passengers
 	4- The cabin and crew, who get a calcium substitute more
 	   readily controlled by a quorum of preservatory agencies.
 	5 (optional:) - Premium services and DRM for checked laptops.
 They reactivate calcium channels and put the calcium back when
 you arrive.  If you don't like it, you have to claim it as they put the
 calcium back, subject to retries, and you have to remember the flight
 number you actually arrived on to do that.
 
 ...and you suddenly know all about vendors!

 Planning battle tactics; for this reason, the intelligence press
 reports, spy satellites have had 1-meter resolution for many years.
 
 Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be possible
 with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.
 
 For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably cheaper
 to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take some snapshots
 from ground level.  Aerial photos might be cheaper for large areas,
 areas where you're not allowed --- or, perhaps, physically able --- to
 go, and cases where you don't have time to send a ground guy around
 the whole area.

 They were the ruling class of a feudal, farming society for quite some
 time; I believe there were more than a few issues there. Certainly, not
 everyone in Tibet is as excited about the Dalai Lama as Hollywood
 appears to be. [Not that the Chinese are much better rights-wise, but
 they've actually built roads and such, which led to the creation of
 merchant classes and the like that never existed under the Tibetans.]

 I added code to my procmailrc (on the other account) so that anything that 
 comes on Bugtraq and is in Razor is revoked. Bugtraq is moderated, so spam 
 doesn't get through it. The recipe revoked a message about an hour after I

 Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
 rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
 uninstalls must be done without the version info like
 rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or 
 rpm -e sendmail-devel. 
 
 give that a go and it should work np.

 Don't worry about the warnings. To fix the error, edit spamc.c and right 
 after the line that says:
 
 #define EX__MAX 77
 
 Add:
 
 #if !defined __osf__
 extern char *optarg;
 typedef unsigned long   in_addr_t;      /* base type for internet address */
 #endif
 
 (you're adding the two lines that start with #).

 Broadband's killer application  the one activity that dwarfs all others 
 is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according
 to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
 millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer
 games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming
 uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.
 
 ""Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,"" said Kim Hyun
 Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction
 Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with
 Internet game addiction. ""Young people are losing the ability to relate to
 others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to
 violence, even when they are not playing.

 That 1 is unneeded and is probably whats upsetting your kernel

 I worked on a testharness for (wait for it) petrol pumps some years ago,
 little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
 environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
 piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
 creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
 extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
 out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
 predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
 recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
 one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
 sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
 me.

 Ah the great spam debate wages on ...
 
 So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)
 
 Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is
 that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school
 accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of
 mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go
 through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends
 that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into
 the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  
 Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I
 haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my
 carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets
 considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.
 When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or
 whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even
 _better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change
 my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I
 can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to
 my @hotmail account.
 
 I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only
 fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting
 to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be
 willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist
 provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was
 referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us
 tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the
 whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more
 knowledgable.
 
 My half a cent here...
 
 <sidenote>: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving
 thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)
 Woo hoo!   Law school!)   </sidenote>

 The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
 of the speakers choice.
 
 Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
 pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,
 but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is
 pretty weak.

 Sure.  I described it the way I understand it to another person off 
 list a little while ago.
 
 
 It has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser 
 [sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the 
 reporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their 
 attitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the 
 generic meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the 
 appropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't 
 seem to find the page though.
 
 
 LART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting 
 Rumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much 
 better response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. 
 I'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes 
 on our system disrupted service to our customers and that we 
 therefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better 
 response.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump 
 it to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs 
 of hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)

 You aren't the first person to ask this question, but over the last few
 years there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics
 research folks.  As I understand it, there is a growing body of genetic
 evidence that European immune systems are substantially tougher and more
 resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other
 peoples around the world, including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary
 immunities and partial immunities/resistance to common viruses and bacteria
 found around the world.  As a result, when the first wholesale mixing of
 people from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular
 basis, the Europeans fared much better than most others.
 
 The standard theory for this is that Europe was the first major region of
 the planet to become densely populated and urbanized (to the extent that
 they ""urbanized"" a thousand years ago).  Because of this, Europe was a
 festering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and
 medicine for a thousand plus years, much more so than the rest of the world
 and suffered from repeated large-scale epidemics and plagues that took
 severe tolls on the population.  Modern ethnic Europeans have genetics that
 survived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of
 diseases over dozens of generations.
 
 What the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the world's
 most common infectious diseases, there is a percentage of the ethnically
 European population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment
 that has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other
 parts of the world.  And for most ethnic Europeans it isn't just one
 disease, they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable
 cornucopia of infectious diseases.  Because of similarities in the
 mechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the
 world to ones that Europeans were exposed to, the robust defenses their
 genetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted
 some resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed.

 Well, from what I've tried, both the main and the PCM (at least) volume

 I guess/hope some other people from the list will try it out ;-)
 
 Both problems you reported (libasound.so and wrong xine dependency) are now
 fixed in the current packages.
 
 Oh, it's maybe also worth pointing out : I've implemented at last sorting
 by both last change date and alphabetically for my ""build list"" in the php
 code : http://freshrpms.net/builds/
 
 And yes, I accept patches/comments/suggestions about all those spec files!

 So, just write-protect the hard disk for partitions that are static.
 I seem to recall an article on this (early 80's, Byte magazine, perhaps?)
 for BBS systems or for testing unknown (perhaps trojan horse) software.

  Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
  Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing
 
 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
 Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
 of 
 desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.
 
 Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
 Technology, Inc. today
 announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
 e-security. This strategic
 partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
 protocol used by every e-based
 desktop, laptop and server. 
 
 Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
 Technology's award-winning Magi
 Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
 encryption to every
 Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
 between workgroups within and
 beyond the enterprise.
 
 Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
 network infrastructures. This
 combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
 security tools for each desktop
 application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
 can now be rapidly, easily and
 securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
 partners and clients without concern
 in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
 highly securely with strong
 encryption and authentication across firewalls.
 
 ""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
 Bernard Hulme, chairman and
 CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
 managers with added
 assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
 peer-to-peer computing""
 
 Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
 interoperability between
 partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA
 ClearTrust Web access
 management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.
 
 The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
 and advertising, be listed in
 RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
 It will also lead to joint
 marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
 joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
 business continuity support.
 
 ""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
 products and streamlining the
 deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
 combining our products,
 enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""

 As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
 being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
 a <a href=""http://idg.net/ic_886816_1794_9-
 10000.html"">startling revelation</a> that Microsoft refuses 
 to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
 very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
 intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
 they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
 cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
 say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
 desktops based on AMD processors!
 
 <p>Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
 software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
 blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
 decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why 
 is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
 that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
 place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
 is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
 deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? 
 Things that make you go hmmmm...

 <b>SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind</b>

 <p>During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
 various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
 setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
 captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
 certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
 text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
 hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
 Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned

 <p>A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
 care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
 items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
 allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
 different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
 improper permissions within the registry. All three are

 <p>Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
 do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
 just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
 problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
 explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
 can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
 into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
 certain you know what you're messing with or you could just

59,"I propose they rename it ""Charlie Heston High"" and maybe the students  
 will learn to take AR-15s with extended military-spec scopes and .223  
 high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in  
 the suburbs of Washington.  That's far more effectual than blowing  
 oneself up in a bus.
 
 In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political  
 doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant.  But random violence  
 is entertainment and intrigue.
 
 A couple of ex-FBI ""consultants"" speaking on the shootings in DC were  
 quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a  
 ""heroin-like high"" from each successful kill and that they ""for  
 whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose  
 at law enforcement and society.""
 
 See?  Just a couple of kids having fun with Daddy's semi-automatic  
 hunting rifle.  Harmless!

 When reviewing the Toshiba Pocket PC e740, I spent a lot of time trying to understand its XScale processor. A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-powered PDA.

 Yup. It's alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++ Sorry about that.
 
 I've never used the group, so I can't vouch for it's usefulness.
 But a few people I respect a lot direct people there for beginner

 Yeah, I disabled the subject rewrite.  I also lowered required_hits 
 to 1 (wonder if I can do zero) so that almost all mail is scored--I'm 
 testing it right now.  auto_report_threshold was raised to 100 to 
 make sure that all mail gets through to me for now.

 Ah, now I didn't notice this.  I rather like this option.  I may set

 This makes sense.  I may do that for just this reason.  Thanks!

 Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
 OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
 who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
 fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
 who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
 over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. 
 
 Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
 business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
 is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
 Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
 of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) 
 
 Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
 with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
 a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
 appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
 to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
 amount of money. 
 
 Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
 That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. 
 
 But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
 to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
 on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
 dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
 in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
 environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
 in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
 magic 25 multiplier.

 SECTION: Main News Main News; Part 1; Page 13; National Desk
 LENGTH: 1013 words
 BYLINE: DANA CALVO, TIMES STAFF WRITER
 DATELINE: SEATTLE
 
 BODY:
 
 The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a
 public-policy think tank here.
 
 The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into
 his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an
 unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on
 espresso.
 
 That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,
 and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one
 that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,
 after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound
 of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000
 residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle
 also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's
 Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.
 
 A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the
 tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the
 consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,""
 said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was
 common sense.""
 
 Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that
 people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But
 because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on
 espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.
 
 Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a
 year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research
 shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.
 
 Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The
 think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of
 low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.
 
 Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs
 made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would
 provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,
 improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.
 
 At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of
 customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.
 
 Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an
 extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with
 it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got
 to come from somewhere.""
 
 Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she
 brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She
 supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be
 expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on
 the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.
 
 Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.
 
 David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a
 day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for
 one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a
 leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I
 think everyone should pay.""
 
 Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as
 JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's
 Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,
 Starbucks and Tully's.
 
 The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that
 contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare
 for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If
 espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a
 city audit.
 
 University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. 
 
 ""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is
 neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead
 to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to
 avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using
 finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]
 and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be
 right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal
 fees that could have gone to child care.
 
 ""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious
 idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso
 drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with
 the espresso drinkers?""
 
 In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political
 two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public
 stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,
 corporations continually advertise their commitment to social
 activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members
 prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.
 
 ""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and
 childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we
 contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not
 understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an
 additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single
 consumer product.""
 
 The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before
 voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at
 vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through
 higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.
 The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of
 espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.
 
 Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of
 consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been
 pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime
 every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.
 
 It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds
 funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

 You should also enable raw mode (ctrl-w) and delimiters (ctrl-r) before 
 directing messages to the pipe. Raw mode includes the headers and 
 delimiters allow several messages to be submitted.

 If you're developing Windows applications in an
 ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
 such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
 advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
 controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
 every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
 handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
 and edit hex code to get you up and running.<p>
 
 
 
 Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
 <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=1a-y6ZkIlXH6wJ46AOd5q0_HZB17WsR"" >FileSystem 1.2</a> and <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=2f-hYaFIqnzAaETrfOP26D_8gaZjMZR"" >AppSecureX 2.9</a>. FileSystem gives you access
 to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
 serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
 applications.<p>

 Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
    FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
    file information under Windows through three independent
    interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
    I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
    Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
    media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
    unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
    files, and even load logbook files into collections
    automatically. Rope in your files.<P>
 
  <B><a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=83-U-BXQYJ7lFkYQzCtuoAABMMPZ9FR"" >ApSecureX 2.9</A></B><BR>
 Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
    This control provides a registration system that produces a
    valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
    the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
    generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
    user must provide you with his installation number. The
    data file created by the application is encrypted
    differently for each system, so even if someone were to
    crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
    another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
    shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking

 AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
    Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
    addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
    uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
    using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
    possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
    customization, and the user interface includes support for
    12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
    applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
    feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
    file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
    support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
    HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
    Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
    shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
    your files.<P>

 exmh uses the profile setting - it appears as mhProfile(unseen-sequence)

 Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the
 situation.  There's good design and bad design. 
 There's good testing and bad testing.  The problem
 is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody
 does.  I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up
 on main street Web enablement yet.  There's some
 really great packages on how to do this stuff and
 in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed
 to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms
 and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and
 people usually do.  What the problem is, they don't
 even recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They just
 keeping trundling along making a mess of everything
 assured in their job security that they can build
 Web forms without even caring if they can be
 used or not beyond their test machine.
 
 If you had a piece of software and a security warning
 came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?
 Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally
 broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know
 is why would someone use Web forms best practices from
 5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that
 time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows
 or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window
 manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for
 a brief period of time, but they are completely useless
 except for some terminal based replacement applications. 
 
 The bottom line is, if you can't get across the
 bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault
 it really is, and it's the business that 
 needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that
 wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

 There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With
 static object allocation and a few other programming
 techniques, performance differences disappear, but
 C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
 The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every
 embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have
 C++ compilers. But there is still a range of
 platforms that have the first but not the second. Or
 at least, that was the story a few years ago.

 The New York Times and Los Angeles Times both lead with word that
 a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest
 national gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas
 from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01.
 The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity
 in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and
 helping to induce rolling blackouts. 
 
 and this is the product of overregulation?

 Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
 regulation.
 
 The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
 It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
 spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
 example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
 tons of money on public housing.
 
 As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
 both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
 EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
 much anathema to liberal politics.
 
 Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
 government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
 replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
 regulation itself.
 
 And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
 include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
 watermelon.

 Right you are.  The SRPM includes a patch to enable it, but then the
 specfile defaults to not applying that patch.  I saw the former but
 missed the later.  Egad, what a convoluted maze.

 Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
 sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
 there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
 work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
 passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
 proper focus set.
 
 I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
 some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

 CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP
 
    Original release date: July 22, 2002
    Last revised: --
    Source: CERT/CC
 
    A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.
 
 Systems Affected
 
      * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1
 
 Overview
 
    A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could
    be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP
    and/or the web server.
 
 I. Description
 
    PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more
    information about PHP, see
 
           http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php
 
    The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for
    handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a
    specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can
    corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an
    intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be
    freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or
    the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to
    take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the
    privileges of the web server.
 
    You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some
    implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the
    execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own
    memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is
    irrelevant to this problem.
 
    Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot
    execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system
    administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard
    against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques
    that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.
 
    This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described
    in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an
    advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status
    regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.
 
    Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,
    e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older
    versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we
    encourage you to review
    http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html
 
 II. Impact
 
    A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
    An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due
    to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage
    this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an
    x86 architecture.
 
 III. Solution
 
 Apply a patch from your vendor
 
    Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
    As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
    section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
    vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
    Please contact your vendor directly.
 
 Upgrade to the latest version of PHP
 
    If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version
    4.2.2.
 
 Deny POST requests
 
    Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST
    requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security
    Advisory:
 
      If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on
      HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST
      requests on the web server.
 
      In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the
      following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a
      top-level .htaccess file:
 
      <Limit POST>
         Order deny,allow
         Deny from all
      </Limit>
 
      Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
      parameters contradicting the example given above.
 
 Disable vulnerable service
 
    Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.
    As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that
    are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully
    consider your service requirements.
 
 Appendix A. - Vendor Information
 
    This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
    advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
    update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
    particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
    comments.
 
 Apple Computer Inc.
 
           Mac  OS  X  and  Mac  OS X Server are shipping with PHP version
           4.1.2  which  does  not  contain the vulnerability described in
           this alert.
 
 Caldera
 
           Caldera  OpenLinux  does  not provide either vulnerable version
           (4.2.0,  4.2.1)  of  PHP  in their products. Therefore, Caldera
           products are not vulnerable to this issue.
 
 Compaq Computer Corporation
 
           SOURCE:  Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary
           of  Hewlett-Packard  Company  and  Hewlett-Packard  Company  HP
           Services Software Security Response Team
           x-ref: SSRT2300 php post requests
           At  the  time  of  writing  this  document, Compaq is currently
           investigating   the   potential  impact  to  Compaq's  released
           Operating System software products.
           As  further  information  becomes available Compaq will provide
           notice  of  the  availability  of any necessary patches through
           standard  security bulletin announcements and be available from
           your normal HP Services supportchannel.
 
 Cray Inc.
 
           Cray, Inc. does not supply PHP on any of its systems.
 
 Debian
 
           Debian GNU/Linux stable aka 3.0 is not vulnerable.
           Debian GNU/Linux testing is not vulnerable.
           Debian GNU/Linux unstable is vulnerable.
           The  problem  effects PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. Woody ships
           an  older  version  of  PHP  (4.1.2),  that doesn't contain the
           vulnerable function.
 
 FreeBSD
 
           FreeBSD  does not include any version of PHP by default, and so
           is  not  vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does
           contain  the  PHP4  package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in
           progress  and a corrected package will be available in the near
           future.
 
 Guardian Digital
 
           Guardian  Digital  has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of
           EnGarde, therefore we are not believed to be vulnerable at this
           time.
 
 Hewlett-Packard Company
 
           SOURCE:  Hewlett-Packard Company Security Response Team
           At  the  time  of  writing  this  document,  Hewlett Packard is
           currently  investigating  the potential impact to HP's released
           Operating System software products.
           As further information becomes available HP will provide notice
           of  the  availability of any necessary patches through standard
           security  bulletin  announcements  and  be  available from your
           normal HP Services support channel.
 
 IBM
 
           IBM  is  not vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities in PHP. We
           do  supply the PHP packages for AIX through the AIX Toolbox for
           Linux  Applications.  However,  these packages are at 4.0.6 and
           also incorporate the security patch from 2/27/2002.
 
 Mandrakesoft
 
           Mandrake Linux does not ship with PHP version 4.2.x and as such
           is  not  vulnerable.  The  Mandrake Linux cooker does currently
           contain  PHP  4.2.1  and  will  be  updated shortly, but cooker
           should  not be used in a production environment and no advisory
           will be issued.
 
 Microsoft Corporation
 
           Microsoft  products  are not affected by the issues detailed in
           this advisory.
 
 Network Appliance
 
           No Netapp products are vulnerable to this.
 
 Red Hat Inc.
 
           None  of  our commercial releases ship with vulnerable versions
           of PHP (4.2.0, 4.2.1).
 
 SuSE Inc.
 
           SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to this problem, as we do not ship
           PHP 4.2.x.

 It seems that something changed during the last 3-4 weeks.
 
 1) In a folder, msgs 1-n is read, n=current, n upwards is unread.
 2) change to another folder
 3) change back to the original folder and you'll see msg n+1 being 
 highlighted as current for a split second, that it changes back to 
 n=current.
 
 Kind of annoying since it marks msg n+1 as read.

 Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
 Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
 These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
 domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
 unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
 life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
 public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
 it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)

 Well, you could damn well get a fucking better attitude.
 I practically handed you a job the other week and you
 pissed all over me. I'm done helping you. You have joined
 a very exclusive club that up to now has only had my sister

 This is exactly what I think. SpamAssassin has always been conservative
 about adding unproven RBLs and such, and this should be the same.

 I say start it with a zero score and put it in 70_cvs_rules_under_test like
 any other unproven rule. Then score it based on actual results, not
 promises. My corpus does not yet contain a single non-spam (or spam) message
 with a Habeas mark. Based on that, it doesn't impress me and it wouldn't
 impress the GA either. Rules with exactly the same statistics are being
 dropped from SA right now, and I don't see why this should be any different.

 When I worked as a PC repair tech for a Computer store chain, I did
 run across quite a few DVD drives that would lock up if DMA was
 enabled.  It's more of a chipset/drive problem than a Drive by itself.

 Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits.  Start drilling right
 through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop
 off and through the board!  Once you have a bit of an indent in,
 increase the speed a little bit.
 
 If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use
 the next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.
 
 Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the
 board off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the
 rest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.

102,"I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
 Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
 exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.
 
 Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
 Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
 ""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
 socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).
 
 Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
 well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
 executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
 community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
 finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
 hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.
 
 So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

 What do you mean by ""CD-Key or the like"" (I presume that ""of"" was a
 typo)? And what do you mean by ""unbreakable""?
 
 You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
 solve, and about the constraints involved.
 
 Some general points:
 
 1. For a conventional ""CD key"" system, where the actual CDs are
 mass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire
 system has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys
 being ""traded"" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the
 product).
 
 If there's an online element involved, you can ""tie"" keys to a
 specific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's
 ""product activation"".
 
 2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be
 vulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within
 the executable.
 
 3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to
 ""cracking"", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the
 validation checks.
 
 This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a
 Palladium-style system).
 
 Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only
 accessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a
 meaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts
 and discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).
 
 IOW, you have to ""keep the genie in the bottle"" at all times. If the
 data can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated
 hardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and
 distributed without limit.

 In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
 you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
 will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
 just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
 reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?
 
 With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
 the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
 this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
 change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
 will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
 precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

 I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my

 Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
 fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
 339M that took almost 3 hours.
 
 Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
 patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
 the process. 
 
 Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
 new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
 day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
 kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
 the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
 in under 20 hour increments.

 Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other
 than put up the ftp version, but surely they
 can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy and
 giving it to me?
 
 What is the GPL all about then?

 But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not

 Nobody can oblige them to give away anything
 other than ftp - I'm not asking for that. I'm
 asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to
 burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange
 for a reasonable consideration (say, the price of
 the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of
 pints?).
 
 
 What does the GPL mean now?
 
 
 I don't want their 60 days of free email support
 or anything similar (if I did, I would pay for

 lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I 
 just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the 
 scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.
 
 I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 
 msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:
 
 2.5-release: 350-450 msec
 latest cvs: 1000-12000 msec
 
 Frankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the 
 user settings hasn't changed.
 
 Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?

116,"On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
 which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
 itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
 for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
 that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
 anyone else.
 
 If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
 very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
 
 At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
 known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
 vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
 while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
 --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
 vulnerability, if possible.  
 
 This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
 CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
 disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
 any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
 a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
 vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
 on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
 wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
 was.
 
 The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
 exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
 disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
 underground, vulnerable.
 
 The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
 are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
 reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
 turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
 detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
 useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
 security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
 prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
 long as possible.
 
 iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
 than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
 a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
 discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
 
 Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
 including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
 secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
 vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
 Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
 HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
 extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
 information.
 
 If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
 together, add up to a catastrophe.
 
 First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
 the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
 I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
 syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
 
 Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
 become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
 --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
 guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
 of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
 
 I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
 vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
 plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
 them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
 people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
 credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
 Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
 administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
 negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
 
 I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
 information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
 execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
 means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
 are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
 
 There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
 Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
 than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
 Samba, for example.
 
 Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
 motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
 interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
 personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
 a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
 increase the availability of that information to the people who can
 afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
 
 Let's not let that happen.
 
 
 
 
 This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:
 
 From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]
 Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM
 Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
 
 
 Greetings,
 
 iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
 Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
 notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
 
 iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
 provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
 
 Q. How will it work?
 A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
 security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
 of motivations, including the following:
 
          * Pure love of security research
          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
 
 The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
 Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
 work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
 items:
 
          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
          * The amount of detail and analysis provided
          * The potential severity level for the information shared
          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
            software and hardware potentially affected
          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE
 
 Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
 A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
 entity.
 
 Q. Why are you launching this program?
 A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
 to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
 often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
 original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
 compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
 public at large are warned in a timely manner.
 
 Q. Who gets the credit?
 A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
 exploit information.
 
 Q. When can I contribute?
 The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.
 
 To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
 questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
 contact us at contributor@idefense.com.

 I'd say that the file apt downloaded is corrupted. Maybe trying ""apt-get

122,"Hi,
 
 when testing spamassassin, i found a little problem but
 I don't know if it's spamassassin or my pop3-server
 that caused it.
 
 Pop3-servers seem to expect a blank line before ""From ""-lines
 to seperate mails in a mailbox-file.
 Spamassassin does not add such a blank line before
 mails delivered directly to mailbox.
 Result is that the pop3-server (tested with qpopper4 and
 cucipop) delivers some mails glued together.
 
 I think the solution is to write a blank line to the mailbox
 befor spamassassin adds the filtered mail.
 
 Please tell me if you're not the right man for this,
  if i'm totally wrong or if you're sure, the pop3-server
  shouldn't insist on a blank line before ""From ""-lines.

 <h3>USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST</h3>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are two <code>Collections</code> classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an <code>ArrayList</code> of Strings, or a <code>LinkedList</code> of Integers. This tip compares the performance of <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code>, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The first key point is that an <code>ArrayList</code> is backed by a primitive <code>Object</code> array. Because of that, an <code>ArrayList</code> is much faster than a <code>LinkedList</code> for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the <code>get</code> method. Note that the <code>get</code> method is implemented for <code>LinkedLists</code>, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a <code>LinkedList</code>, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo1 {
         static final int N = 10000;
 
         static List values;
 
         // make List of increasing Integer values
 
         static {
            Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];
 
            Random rn = new Random();
 
            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                vals[i] = new Integer(currval);
                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
            }
 
            values = Arrays.asList(vals);
         }
         
         // iterate across a list and look up every
         // value in the list using binary search
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
 
                // look up a value in the list 
                // using binary search
 
                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                    lst, values.get(i));
 
                // sanity check for result 
                // of binary search
 
                if (indx != i) {
                    System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                }
            }
 
            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }
 
        public static void main(String args[]) {
 
            // do lookups in an ArrayList 
 
            System.out.println(&quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                timeList(new ArrayList(values)));
 
            // do lookups in a LinkedList
 
            System.out.println(
                &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                timeList(new LinkedList(values)));
        }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ListDemo1</code> program sets up a <code>List</code> of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Then <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> is used to search for each value in the 
 list.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 31
 
     time for LinkedList = 4640
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> is about 150 times faster than <code>LinkedList</code>. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for <code>ArrayList</code> as compared to that for <code>LinkedList</code>. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, <code>LinkedList</code> is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and <code>LinkedList</code> does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a <code>LinkedList</code> is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an <code>ArrayList</code> has a fixed time.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You can use the <code>RandomAccess</code> marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     void f(List lst) {
         if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {
             // supports fast random access
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> implements the <code>RandomAccess</code> interface, and <code>LinkedList</code>. does not. Note that <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> does take advantage of the <code>RandomAccess</code> property, to optimize searches.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Do these results prove that <code>ArrayList</code> is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where <code>LinkedList</code> does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for <code>LinkedList</code>. An example is reversing a <code>LinkedList</code> using <code>Collections.reverse</code>. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, <code>LinkedList</code> is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following &quot;worst case&quot; scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo2 {
         static final int N = 50000;
 
         // time how long it takes to add 
         // N objects to a list
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             Object obj = new Object();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 lst.add(0, obj);
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         public static void main(String args[]) {
 
             // do timing for ArrayList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new ArrayList()));
 
             // do timing for LinkedList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new LinkedList()));
         }
     } 
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, the result should look something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 4859
 
     time for LinkedList = 125
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When an element is added to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code>, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code> has a cost that's proportional to the list size.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The <code>LinkedList</code> class has a private internal class defined like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static class Entry {
         Object element;
         Entry next;
         Entry previous;
     } 
 </pre>
 
 
 <p>
 Each <code>Entry</code> object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the <code>LinkedList</code> -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A <code>LinkedList</code> of 1000 elements will have 1000 <code>Entry</code> objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a <code>LinkedList</code> structure, given all these <code>Entry</code> objects.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 An <code>ArrayList</code> has a backing <code>Object</code> array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an <code>ArrayList</code> with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way <code>ArrayList</code> works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If you know how many elements will be in an <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the <code>trimToSize</code> method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this discussion has assumed that either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code> is &quot;right&quot; for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You could store the pairs in an N x 2 <code>Object</code> array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of <code>ArrayLists</code>, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a <code>HashMap</code>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Which is faster, a binary search on an <code>ArrayList</code>, or a <code>HashMap</code>? Here's a final example that compares these two:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo3 {
         static final int N = 500000;
 
         // Lists of keys and values
 
         static List keys;
         static List values;
 
         // fill the keys list with ascending order key 
         // values and fill the values list with
         // corresponding values (-key)
 
         static {
             Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N];
             Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N];
 
             Random rn = new Random();
 
             for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval);
                 valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval);
                 currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
             }
 
             keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec);
             values = Arrays.asList(valuevec);
         }
 
         // fill a Map with key/value pairs
 
         static Map map = new HashMap();
 
         static {
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i));
             }
         }
 
         // do binary search lookup of all keys
 
         static long timeList() {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                     keys, keys.get(i));
 
                 // sanity check of returned value 
                 // from binary search
 
                 if (indx != i) {
                     System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                 }
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         // do Map lookup of all keys
 
         static long timeMap() {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 Integer value = (Integer)map.get(
                                           keys.get(i));
 
                 // sanity check of value returned 
                 // from map lookup
 
                 if (value != values.get(i)) {
                     System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                 }
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         public static void main(String args[]) {
 
             // do timing for List implementation
 
             System.out.println(""List time = "" + 
                                            timeList());
 
             // do timing for Map implementation
 
             System.out.println(&quot;Map time = &quot; + 
                                             timeMap());
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The program sets up <code>Lists</code> of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run the <code>ListDemo3</code> program, you should get a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     ArrayList time = 1000
 
     HashMap time = 281
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the <code>ArrayList</code> will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:
 </p>
 
 <ul>
   <li>Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList.</code> For <code>ArrayList</code>, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For <code>LinkedList</code>, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal <code>Entry</code> object.</li>
 
   <li>Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an <code>ArrayList</code> implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost.</li>
 
   <li>A <code>LinkedList</code> does not support efficient random access</li>
 
   <li>An <code>ArrayList</code> has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A <code>LinkedList</code> has significant space overhead per element.</li>
 
   <li>Sometimes a <code>Map</code> structure is a better choice than a <code>List</code>.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS</h3>
 
 <p>
 Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates &quot;outliers,&quot; that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo1 {
     
         // filter input array and throw away values 
         // that are less than minval or greater than 
         // maxval
     
         static int[] filterData(
                 int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {
     
             // check parameters for errors 
     
             if (indata == null) {
                 throw new NullPointerException(
                                      &quot;indata is null&quot;);
             }
             if (maxval &lt; minval) {
                 throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                 &quot;maxval &lt; minval&quot;);
             }
     
             // count number of valid values 
             // in input array
     
             int validcnt = 0;
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                          &lt;= maxval) {
                     validcnt++;
                 }
             }
     
             // if no valid values, return null
     
             if (validcnt == 0) {
                 return null;
             }
     
             // copy valid values to new array 
             // and return it
     
             int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
             for (int i = 0, j = 0; 
                               i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                            &lt;= maxval) {
                     outdata[j++] = indata[i];
                 }
             }
             return outdata;
         }
     
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up test array of integers
     
             int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};
     
             // filter out values not in the range 1-10
     
             int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata1.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata1[i]);
             }
     
             // filter out values not 
             // in the range 100-200
     
             int outdata2[] = filterData(
                                      indata, 100, 200);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata2.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata2[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>filterData</code> method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     1
     3
     8
     Exception in thread &quot;main&quot;
     java.lang.NullPointerException
         at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of <code>filterData</code> returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     /*
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return null;
     }
     */
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 For the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return outdata;
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Note that usage such as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[]{};
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = 
                                             new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo2 {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up ArrayList and add strings to it
     
             List stringlist = new ArrayList();
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 1&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 2&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 3&quot;);
     
             // convert to String array
     
             String out[] = (
                           String[])stringlist.toArray(
             new String[0]);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; out.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(out[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     string 1
     string 2
     string 3
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program sets up an <code>ArrayList</code>, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls <code>toArray</code> to get a <code>String</code> array of the three elements in the <code>ArrayList</code>. In this example, the argument to <code>toArray</code> is &quot;new String[0]&quot;. This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a <code>String</code> array that's big enough to hold the elements of the <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify it as the argument to <code>toArray</code>. The method will use the <code>String</code> array.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But if your array is not big enough, then the <code>toArray</code> method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. <code>ArrayList</code> stores its element references in an <code>Object</code> array. The <code>toArray</code> method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (<code>java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance</code>) to create an array of the appropriate type.
 </p>

 Anything equivalent will be spam, just not email spam.  Dump entry IPs for
 an anonymizing network onto a public bulletin board that's used for other
 purposes -- still spam.  Etc etc.
 
 I'm not arguing against other solutions, I'm arguing that spam is speech.

 ""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
 negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  
 
 I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
 patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
 words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
 can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  
 
 At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
 We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
 So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
 advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
 I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
 it, you can too.

 Actually, it means just the opposite. The first

 that. For the outlets where he has editorial
 control, it even guarantees his right to CENSOR

 first amendment doesn't limit Harley's speech,

 No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:
 
 	# mount -o remount,rw /usr
 
 This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
 users anyway.
 
 Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
 that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
 remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
 and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
 apologies.)

 According to some old documentation (man exmh-ref)
 
      The mouse bindings for the folders labels are:
 
           Left - Change to folder.
           Middle - View nested folders.
           Right - Refile current messages to the folder.
           Shift-Right - Link current messages to the folder.
           Shift-Middle - Drag a folder label to some drop target.
           Control-Right - Clear the current target folder.
 
 It should be possible to link using shift-right-click the same way you 
 can move using only right-click.

 Unfortunately, the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer
 possible to cut/paste within one sedit window, some intermediate client
 always must be used (except in the rare case where you want to select
 some text, and then paste it at the same place).
 
 That's because the click that you have to (with this option) make to set
 the insert point, also kills the selection (it ends up reverting to the
 last selection made in some other window, or something like that).
 
 So, the vast majority of people probably want that ""Paste Sets Insert""
 enabled - that one you can learn to live with, the other is much more
 painful.

 Heh. I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first
 started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
 then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.
 
 course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. 
 
 Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
 thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
 spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

 1. What laptop is it?  What is the Processor and how much RAM does it have?
 
 2. You cannot simply boot off the cdrom?  It must be quite an old laptop
 then or else cdrom booting is disabled in the BIOS.  Is the cdrom external
 or strange in some way?

 Red Hat Network has determined that the following advisory is applicable to
 one or more of the systems you have registered:
 
 Complete information about this errata can be found at the following location:
      https://rhn.redhat.com/network/errata/errata_details.pxt?eid=1159
 
 Security Advisory - RHSA-2002:158-09
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Summary:
 New kernel update available, fixes i810 video oops, several security issues
 
 Updated kernel packages are now available which fix an oops in the i810 3D
 kernel code. This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in
 the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security
 holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits.
 
 Description:
 The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that
 were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with
 the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger
 race in the dcache of the file system subsystem.
 
 This kernel update addresses both of these issues.
 
 In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following
 drivers:
 
 stradis
 rio500
 se401
 usbvideo
 apm
 
 Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had
 the capability to expose kernel memory when abused.
 
 All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the
 time of this writing, have any known exploits.
 
 We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar
 Designer, and others for their auditing work.

 Just a big *thank you* to Chris for being willing to dive in and get
 very messy.  The sequence management code is some of the very oldest
 in exmh, and surely suffered as features were added over several years.
 When this stabilizes, it will be a great excuse for a 2.6 release.

 Battery pack, huh what???
 
 You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
 the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
 the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
 anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
 200 MPH should be no problem.

  Null, the third beta was out last week.
 
  It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
 large projects.
 
  I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...
 
  Though many say ""RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish"" - it's worth baring in
 mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
 just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.

 way to customize the tokenizer and testers is via creating your own

 I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can 
 achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't 
 factored in to the GA scores.
 
 The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of 
 doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
 really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
 time goes on.
 
 The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
 better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
 2.41 or 2.50 branches.
 
 DQ> Something like:
 DQ> 
 DQ>   for (low = -12; low <= -4; low += 2)
 DQ>     for (high = 2; high <= 6; high += 2)
 DQ>       evolve
 
 You could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd 
 be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
 that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The 
 issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
 human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
 and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
 liable to be forged to generate FNs.
 
 DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.
 
 Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just 
 alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.

 clever. A bit more robust is:
 #first param is number of
 #times to repeat second param
 #
 #e.g. quote=`repeat 3 '> '`
 repeat() {
      seq -s , $1 | sed ""s[0-9]\{1,\}[,]*$2g""

 Dunno.. Some of the new Sonys (I'm hunting again for a lappy, as the
 Toshiba I have is a large piece of cow manure)  which promise a 4 hour
 battery life off of ONE battery are pretty damn impressive.  As far as
 the keyboard issue, the Toshiba actually came out with a good
 keyboard, nearly equivalent to most standard keyboards (Not ergonomic,
 alas, but I have a USB happy ergo keyboard I can always plug in if I

 Red Hat 8.0 ships with the bytecode hinter enabled; I think 7.3 may have 
 as well.
 
 The enabling change to ""ftoption.h"" is made by Red Hat's SRPM before 
 building.  Take a look at ""freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch"" from the 
 SRPM; it's pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.
 
 So if your fonts look ugly, lack of bytecode hinting is *not* the cause.

158,"What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
 promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
 industry:
 
  o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
    a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
  o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
    about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
    just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
    when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
    time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
  o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
    I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
    listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
    to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
    row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
    about two dozen third world countries. 
  o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
    about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
    you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
  o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
    enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
    automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
    go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
    of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
  o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
  o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
    to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
    is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
    forms submission.
 
 What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
 your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
 someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
 ""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
 freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
 to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  
 
 I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
 this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
 but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field
 that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
 automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
 average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  
 
 So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
 business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
 and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
 working all that well.

 Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs ""date"" before
 and after (or equivalent).
 
 Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing;
 speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be
 quite another.  Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor.
 (The file you wget will probably be precompressed.)
 
 In the area of the slightly more exotic, be aware that different traffic
 may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various
 points in the transit to/from you -- and that some traffic may go via 
 different paths coming vs. going.
 
 Be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that
 matters:  Depending on what you're doing, the modem's connection latency
 might matter, and this differs widely between modems.  (It matters more
 for interactive sessions, e.g., ssh remote logins, where each keystroke
 is echoed from remote.)

 This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
 much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
 just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
 logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
 immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the

 want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
 somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
 the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
 (by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
 immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

 I've sent in some spam that either didn't score or scored practically 
 nothing, like below 5.  I figure that most people run at 5 so if it

   | From: ""Matthew French"" <mfrench42@yahoo.co.uk>
   |[ ... ]
   | Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the ""Deleted Items"" folder.
   | 
   | In the root of a hard drive, create a directory "".unwanted"".
   | Then periodically create hard links to every file on the hard
   | drive that does not have hard links.
   | 
   | That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever,
   | you still have a link under "".unwanted""  [ ... ]
 
  hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
  redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
  with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
  are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
  means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
  considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
  of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
  hard link idea.
 
  but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
  back of accidental overwrites.
 
  ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
   facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
   various ""versioning"" filesystems which appeared --- and
   then vanished? --- over the years.... )
 
  one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
  hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
  files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
  complain if there are hard links.

166,"I recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, ""Electronic
 Publishing"", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.
 All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first
 journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of
 the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly
 from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).
 
 http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.html
 
 Today's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,
 since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this
 journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top
 researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the
 ideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many for
 sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing
 technologies.

 better yet would be a built-in server check on a periodic basis, even
 daily, looking for the existence of an update, and if found prompt the
 system admin to upgrade the server.  With the ever changing face of spam,
 this would probably be a big benefit to SA users and help keep everyone up
 to date.  We have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on
 www.RoseCitySoftware.com strictly because of joe-average-user concerns
 about spyware and ""phoning home"", but in cases where the app needs to
 access the internet anyhow, we have done it with great success and minimal
 concern by our users.

 Disney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war 
 with Iraq could really kill 'em: 
 
     While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by 
     steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver 
     record profit for Disney year after year. 
 
     ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,"" 
     said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. ""It was an astounding 
     growth period.... Now they're overexposed.""... 
 
     Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to 
     $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 
     2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on 
     whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.

 The ADR (Advanced Digital Recording) tape format is an interesting
 option, one I hadn't seen much of, before.  Look as if OnStream (spun
 off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly
 control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make
 compatible media under licence.
 
 If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a
 rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn
 (and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple
 of dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and
 availability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape
 heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan
 systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always
 ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy
 competition.
 
 The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is
 that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement
 that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another 
 OnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm 
 not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed
 them).  
 
 If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into
 the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they 
 get people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order 
 (http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:
 
 42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape
 33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
 66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.
 44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
 47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.
 
 (You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)
 
 Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression
 ratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's ""ADR2"" series says this is a
 linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,
 and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and
 8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).
 
 I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite
 Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection
 is that BRU will do it.
 
 On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3
 or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one
 oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the
 experience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,
 and might be a good bet after all.  As they say in the gaming industry,
 ""Ya pays your money, and ya takes your chances.""

 In my experience, this is classic ""American"" behaviour, and I don't 
 think its on the increase outside of the US of A.
 I am willing to accept the premise that Americans are bigger dickheads

 I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
 saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
 and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
 semi-circle of darker sky.
 
 I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
 recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
 things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
 sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
 atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

 Sun Nabs Storage Startup
 By Clint Boulton
 Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
 Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
 storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.
 
 The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
 with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
 virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
 virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
 into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
 is managed from a central console.
 
 Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
 of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
 scouting some 65 companies.
 
 Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
 that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
 acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
 storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
 as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.
 
 ""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
 or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
 critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""
 
 N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
 architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
 role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
 as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
 networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.
 
 While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
 in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
 according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
 IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
 increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
 respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
 $411 million.
 
 Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
 Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.

 Following further study, I've concluded:
 
    1. It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.
 
    2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.
 
    3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text.
 
 Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. 
   Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a 
 sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, 
 well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with 
 and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear.
 
 Consider the two images attached below.  The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", 
 shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode 
 interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with 
 the bytecode interpreter enabled.
 
 When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several 
 rendering anomalies appear:
 
    - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more
      compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"".
 
    - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey,
      causing it to drop out somewhat.  ""C"", not in this sample, has the
      same problem.
 
    - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient
      whitespace between them.
 
    - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric.
 
    - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled
      with grey.  Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode
      interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop.
 
 Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. 
 It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of 
 making a mess of antialiased rendering.
 
 This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, 
 I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode 
 interpreter turned *off*.

 Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption
 
 Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
 about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
 The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
 spoken in Namibia.
 Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
 translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
 It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
 the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
 According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
 patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
 He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
 One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
 languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
 that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
 Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
 Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
 Siyeyi means testicles.
 Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
 translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
 intercourse.
 The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

 Well, I sure don't claim that... I think most people on Fork probably have

 Well, I think until recently, support for most things on Linux was kind of
 shady... Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to
 suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least
 development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few
 server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had
 no problems with great performance.

 Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a ""Bad""
 programming language or application platform?  You don't think this has
 anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you?  Or that MS has
 basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?
 Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the
 right way to go for most high level applications?

 Hmmm again.... You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took
 you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak?  I am
 not the best C/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really
 good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory
 management, however occasional they may be.

 Wow!  So you're telling me that unless the application involves
 bit-counting, it's trivial?  What about the application itself?  What about
 high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.?  Aren't most
 high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns?
 Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code?  For
 example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks
 (there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating
 system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?

 I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the
 case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large
 applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more
 than three programmers.  In those cases, it's always very hard to get the
 programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc.  With
 Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in
 a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database
 (JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).

 YIKES!  Have you written db code with C/C++ for different databases (just an

 have Informix running on Solaris and you want to port to Windows with MS SQL
 (bad idea...but for the sake of the example), would you rather deal with
 JDBC port or C/C++ port that uses Informix drivers and now you have to use
 ODBC?

 So, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C/C++ for
 everything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way of
 dealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,
 database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I'd like to know if there is
 one accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim
 ignorance...
 
 Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is
 overkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace
 to programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no
 flame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious
 discussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every ""Kid""
 can write a well designed Java program.  Kids typically don't understand
 various design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually
 tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and
 reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++
 than in Java due to existence of standard API's.

 Well, just to take this thread off topic - does anyone know what's

  the only practical alternatives are MS and Real, and that it's likely 
 to cost some $$$ for the software.

 When I'd read that ""getting legal title
 can take 20 years"", when I believe that
 1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
 (and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
 assumed that we were talking about the
 urban poor.
 
 If I see people living in mansions, or
 even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
 they didn't have too much trouble with
 their titles.
 
 If I see people living in shanties and
 haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
 their parcels weren't exactly recorded
 on the government maps, or paid for with
 a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
 lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
 intent on keeping them ""development"" free.
 
 Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
 of America"" to say that outside of Metro
 Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
 two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
 is the boondocks.  But going on that very
 broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
 the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
 the paisanos (who leave behind those who
 remain on a patron's rural land) move to
 Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
 in shantytowns there, at least until they
 can line up a middle-class job.
 
 So, going on two large assumptions, I can
 come up with a scenario under which title
 would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
 somewhere in the midst of a section (or
 whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
 land) and it takes decades of arguing to
 put together a package which somehow can
 both compensate the owner and record lots
 for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
 title to an existing lot, between parties
 who have money, ought not to be a problem.
 
 The obvious solution, at least to us
 barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
 to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
 left as an exercise to come up with one
 which works when many of the agents (are
 perceived to) have negligible NPV.

 What happened to more highly-capitalized
 land?  Putting in trees instead of crops
 sounds like it might sidestep that.

 Yeah but I was right and I was there. The people who were saying that it
 did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
 after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
 the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
 .ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
 secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
 NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
 there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.
 History now but it has an alarming relevance. :)

 Confirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from
 what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
 initial SOA problems. 
 
 I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
 inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
 incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
 the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
 for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
 investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
 company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
 actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
 should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
 of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
 more like e-jit central! :)

 Hijacker High (8/30) 
 Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
 hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, Gail
 Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
 her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
 the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
 with money to help renovate it.

 THE CHAIRMAN	
 by NICHOLAS LEMANN
 He's the other Powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.
 New Yorker, October 8, 2002
 
 Last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first 
 fairly serious American-history course, indignantly reported that the 
 whole subject was incomprehensible. I was shocked. What about Gettysburg 
 and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? 
 Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His 
 class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big 
 beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, 
 there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text 
 and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous 
 decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American 
 history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and 
 reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping 
 for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation 
 of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it 
 become possible to see the federal government's main function as 
 responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, 
 instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic 
 interests.
 
 Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty 
 speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find 
 is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so 
 much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real 
 estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which 
 this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and 
 commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's 
 an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because 
 the public and the pressencouraged by the players, who speak in jargon
 can't get themselves interested.
 
 One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal 
 Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand 
 denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate 
 commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that 
 the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription 
 price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they 
 grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where 
 the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating 
 comedy routine by the commission's chairman.
 
 Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that 
 Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with 
 a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the 
 American economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone 
 and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now 
 F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, 
 because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the 
 ""corporate scandals"" concerns the economic collapse of companies 
 regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, 
 among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is 
 part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney 
 analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the 
 embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the 
 past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions 
 of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a 
 dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.
 
 This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state 
 of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes 
 F.C.C. World's feverish mood (""The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns"") 
 and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of 
 the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I 
 just quoted is followed by this explanation: ""The ILECs appear likely to 
 enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no 
 residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% 
 market share loss in business lines to CLECs."" It's a lot easier to 
 think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.
 
 
 Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the 
 commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially 
 intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes 
 itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael 
 Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, 
 because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. 
 Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which 
 generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about 
 who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the 
 head of a federal agencyhe is thirty-nineand genially charming. 
 Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years 
 one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the 
 F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the 
 arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an 
 ""avid moderate."" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his 
 predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell 
 to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, 
 calls him ""radical and extreme."" Just as often as he's accused of being 
 a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically 
 cautious. ""It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,"" 
 another former chairman, William Kennard, says. ""You have to have an 
 answer."" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate 
 subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the 
 subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated 
 him. ""You don't care about these regulations,"" Hollings said. ""You don't 
 care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the 
 fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over 
 there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and 
 seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive 
 vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a 
 regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your 
 job?""
 
 ""Extremely,"" Powell said, with an amiable smile.
 
 
 One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats 
 and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose 
 of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was 
 created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the 
 New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy 
 cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure 
 that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its 
 other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, 
 the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers 
 unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, 
 well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial 
 supervisionits real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition 
 among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by 
 artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. 
 In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission 
 more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many 
 of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most 
 terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank 
 president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. 
 According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once 
 blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers 
 in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the 
 anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV 
 station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.
 
 
 F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, 
 because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic 
 niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful 
 breakup of A.T. & T.by far the biggest and most important company the 
 commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of 
 self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation 
 ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one 
 long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, 
 which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same 
 company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the 
 mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local 
 phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing 
 to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores 
 everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand 
 millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the 
 telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a ""natural 
 monopoly,"" requiring protection from economic competition and total 
 control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, 
 the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones 
 and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: 
 consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more 
 prosperous, too.
 
 The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
 one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which 
 most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. 
 Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of 
 modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group 
 bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers 
 as ""baby Bells"" and to F.C.C. World as ""arbocks"" (the pronounced version 
 of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to 
 offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance 
 companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for 
 customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would 
 get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more 
 competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and 
 economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by 
 Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as 
 helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that 
 brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of 
 jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose 
 beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's 
 slogans about the ""information superhighway"" and ""building a bridge to 
 the twenty-first century,"" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully 
 sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical 
 correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was 
 supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.
 
 The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, 
 aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like 
 all important interest groups they work with both parties); they 
 immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new 
 competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through 
 rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by 
 Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep 
 the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies 
 like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new 
 companies, ""see-lecks"" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive 
 local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory 
 equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have 
 access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the 
 seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the 
 F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.
 
 Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that 
 he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming 
 condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the 
 see-leckscompanies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligentand 
 into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related 
 technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom 
 boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks 
 and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests 
 of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's 
 former lieutenants told me, ""Reed used to joke that my job was to make 
 sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.""
 
 
 The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the 
 boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more 
 startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: 
 Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and 
 Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys 
 believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative 
 accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so 
 undiscriminating.)
 
 By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been 
 determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the 
 chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of 
 influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. 
 Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; 
 Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and 
 Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as 
 such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most 
 powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of 
 S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant 
 that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he 
 might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy 
 Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he 
 wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative 
 movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than 
 Furchtgott-Roth.
 
 Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared 
 before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and 
 gave a very Michael Powell speechwhimsical, intellectual, and 
 free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)that 
 began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new 
 telecom companies alive. ""In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is 
 often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" Powell said. ""Like the 
 Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast 
 beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the 
 deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's 
 fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the 
 least, so it is thought."" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became 
 chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as 
 part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day 
 of the Bush Administration.
 
 Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead 
 or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in 
 serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite 
 companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically 
 concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing 
 companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in 
 good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged 
 companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the 
 financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications 
 industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells 
 wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and 
 if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national 
 duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. 
 And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the 
 poor health of the long-distance companies.
 
 The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national 
 companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they 
 don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more 
 fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part 
 of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 
 Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were 
 significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of 
 radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five 
 per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news 
 programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary 
 of Viacom.
 
 In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should 
 be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation, springing to the 
 rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try 
 to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should 
 disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the 
 forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle 
 to get new technologyespecially fast Internet connectionsinto the 
 homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An 
 analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and 
 the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush 
 people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush 
 people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many 
 expectations and stirred too many passions.)
 
 But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been 
 conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the 
 F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him 
 signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of 
 the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has 
 been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further 
 infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and 
 the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of 
 F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's 
 having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, 
 when he was asked what he was going to do about the ""digital 
 divide""that is, economic inequality in access to the Internethe said, 
 ""You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and 
 I can't afford one."" At the National Cable & Telecommunications 
 Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of 
 tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a 
 somersault.
 
 
 Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 
 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest 
 Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at 
 the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody 
 else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building 
 looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. 
 Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and 
 fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and 
 walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a 
 jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because 
 of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he 
 became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly 
 the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of 
 the market before the fact""prophylactically,"" as he likes to sayshould 
 wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust 
 litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and 
 then became a protg of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division 
 of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's 
 legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of 
 the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political 
 skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush 
 Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but 
 also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of 
 Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his 
 enduring love of law school""It's sort of like a law-school study 
 session over there,"" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to 
 confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law 
 students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.
 
 I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions 
 of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the 
 airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?
 
 ""I think we'll never know,"" Powell said. ""I don't think it's an 
 automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably 
 the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and 
 say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor 
 puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law 
 about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If 
 a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a 
 similar proposition. There are scholars who argueindeed, the famous 
 Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisthat 
 spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds 
 of ways that we're accustomed to.""
 
 Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he 
 doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He 
 slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in 
 ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who 
 enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions 
 about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he 
 sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he 
 thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications 
 Act had been excessive.
 
 ""I would start with a caveat,"" Powell said. ""Look, I can't fault those 
 judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. 
 They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. 
 But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, 
 anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close 
 to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President 
 on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I 
 don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, 
 or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that 
 were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts 
 reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. 
 But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet 
 excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it 
 certainly was.
 
 ""But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of 
 expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the 
 economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically 
 exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission, by 
 politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a 
 gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones 
 that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to 
 see numbers go up on the board.""
 
 Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. "" 
 'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see 
 thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the 
 Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' "" Now Powell returned 
 to being Powell. ""I think that expectation was astonishingly 
 unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're 
 there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And 
 the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no 
 question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much 
 debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business 
 model.""
 
 How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? ""We could have 
 chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were 
 slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"" 
 Powell said. ""Money chased what seemed like government-promised 
 opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're 
 in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This 
 debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some 
 ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.""
 
 Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there 
 had been a more ""reasonable"" level of investment. ""No, we wouldn't have 
 every home in America with competitive choice yetbut we don't anyway. I 
 don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy 
 that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The 
 part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so 
 would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.""
 
 Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable 
 businesses, either, and they never might. ""Everybody's always saying, 
 'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's 
 quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six 
 years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once 
 every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're 
 looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance 
 business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is 
 breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.""
 
 Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies 
 stronger? ""At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political 
 answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try 
 to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. 
 I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. 
 investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have 
 those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, 
 companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from 
 dying."" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think 
 it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has 
 demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist 
 gesturesin August, for example, five months after disbanding the 
 F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was 
 appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the 
 communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding 
 out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities 
 and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore 
 up the telecom industry.
 
 I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one 
 company provided cable television and only one provided local phone 
 service. ""Yes,"" he said. ""It concerns us that there's one of each of 
 those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one 
 of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications 
 capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."" 
 Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to 
 provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will 
 provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. 
 ""So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question 
 is, Does it stay that way?""
 
 The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of 
 information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that 
 people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, 
 which distorts markets. ""If this were just economics, it's easy. If you 
 were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we 
 know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a 
 market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is 
 other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take 
 the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption 
 there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic 
 viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I 
 think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility 
 that's ascribed to it sometimes.""
 
 Powell explained, ""Sometimes when we see very pointed political or 
 parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the 
 same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh 
 exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off 
 the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, 
 and then we have policies like""here his tone went from ironic to 
 sarcastic""the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis 
 of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed 
 and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic 
 fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.""
 
 
 F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he 
 can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries 
 he regulatesso he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the 
 market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying 
 water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is 
 planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed 
 Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything 
 at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's 
 waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, 
 so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the 
 crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television 
 networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of 
 Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never 
 commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, 
 and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he 
 says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and 
 irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.
 
 ""This is why elections matter,"" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what 
 has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.much 
 more than, say, the war in Afghanistanis a case in which a Gore 
 Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush 
 Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but 
 there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The 
 arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would 
 have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that 
 helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the 
 arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsthe 
 long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their 
 friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not 
 unrecognizably different from America's past.

 what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
 where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
 allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
 knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
 worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
 long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
 time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
 or less?

 I have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day, constantly polling 
 for mail. If they go away for a long weekend, lots of ""friday night spam"" will become 
 ham on sunday night.  (Friday night seems to be the most popular time)
 
 
 > - Your idea here.
 
 Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular email clients"".. As a 
 stop-gap to the auto-ham ..
 
 How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham folder. Most email 
 clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to quickly move ""spam"" into the spam 
 folder. 
 
 Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete function) they can 
 quickly move ham into the ham folder.
 
 In either case, the message would be processed and then destroyed.

 Again, this is not true. Only certain events (reports/revokes) for a spam
 are rewarded and the algorithm for picking these up is based on many
 different factors.

 uh, no, you don't want to make it world-writable.  world-readable.

 Just remember that the .razor and whatever DCC uses needs to be
 world-readable as well.  The solution is then to make a world-writable
 log file for at least Razor.  I like symlinking /dev/null myself.

 efficient?  probably (depends on the user base), but it also takes
 the control away from the user (which may or may not be a good thing,
 depending again on the user base...)

     Ah; ok.  I'll wait.  I've got enough bugs to swat, but I really look forward to it.  Every version before now has seemed to have been bugfixes and meaningful upgrades of subtle stuff; I expect this one to be the ""no excuses to run Windows"" release to which I can point the unwashed hordes.

 I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
 makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
 official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
 provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
  However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.
 
 Good luck...

 Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, and possibly not even
 that.  For the most part, people become wealthy by not being stupid.  I
 always thought ""not being stupid (most of the time)"" was a fairly low
 bar, but apparently most people can't even manage that.
 
 That is really what it all boils down to:  There are lots of ignorant
 and/or stupid people who are quite happy to stay that way, and it is a

 As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans
 who speak english at home and those who do not.  I don't have figures
 that separate those at hand, though.
 
 1989 American Indians (US Pop as a whole) -- Families below poverty
 27.2% (10%), Persons below poverty 31.2 (13.1), Speak a language other
 than English 23 (13.8) Married couple families 65.8 (79.5) Median family
 income $21,619 ($35,225) Per Capita $8,284 ($14,420).
 
 Note: High Income countries in 1989 were defined as having over $6,000
 per capita.  American Indians separated from the rest of the US society
 would still be considered a high-income society.

216,"Hi all,
 
 I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
 that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
 testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
 people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
 that, right? ;-)
 
 I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
 should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
 maybe others, who knows ;-)
 
 Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
 - Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
 - Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
 - Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
 - Install the ""alsa-utils"" package
 
 Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
 /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
 http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
 (very complete and very good documentation!)
 Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)
 
 Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
 to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
 insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
 check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
 e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.
 
 With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
 can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
 hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
 files... that's it!
 
 It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
 thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
 imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
 /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
 %post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
 structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
 default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
 development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
 libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
 which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
 rpm release, so does the architecture!).
 
 I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!
 
 Download :
 http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/
 
 Current spec files :

 (All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )
 
 Matthias
 
 PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
 run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

 There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With
 static object allocation and a few other programming
 techniques, performance differences disappear, but
 C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
 The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every
 embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have
 C++ compilers. But there is still a range of
 platforms that have the first but not the second. Or
 at least, that was the story a few years ago.

 Making a mesh on the move
 
 A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
 reports Peter Rojas
 
 Peter Rojas
 Thursday August 29, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
 anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
 for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
 download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.
 
 This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
 third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
 years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
 technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
 sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
 dream.
 
 Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
 are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
 Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
 with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
 ""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
 proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
 network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
 traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
 reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
 antennas, and improving wireless coverage.
 
 As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
 other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
 networking may be inevitable.
 
 Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
 networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
 connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
 dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
 speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
 technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
 wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
 protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
 faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.
 
 The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
 much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
 problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
 Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
 because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
 connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
 connection.
 
 Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
 to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
 cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
 that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
 100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
 proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
 software.
 
 It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
 Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
 is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
 pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
 acquiring 3G licences.
 
 All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
 to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
 better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
 networks.
 
 But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
 high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
 and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
 music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
 UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.
 
 At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
 person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
 Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
 their favourite songs, movies, and video games.
 
 But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
 MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
 Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
 that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
 employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
 cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
 enterprise networks.
 
 The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
 incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
 high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.
 
 When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
 your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
 was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
 someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

 You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" 
 activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: 
 activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or 
 norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. 
 ""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of 
 distributions rather than averages.
 
 Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let
 there be three pairings which result in each person
 having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have 
 sex with the other two females. 
 
 Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners
 is equal between the sexes, tautologically. 
 
 But here more women than men are:
  - above the single partner threshold
  - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold
  - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners
  - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners
 
 And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) 
 number of partners.
 
 So in this contrived population, females are more 
 ""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is 
 defined uselessly.

 You are not still using sourceforge, are you? If you have any hopes that they 
 are anything but yet another business giving away a free service, then see 
 this: Selling Microsoft VisualStudio on the ""open source development platform"". 
 Nice touch. Click on the image for the original screenshot....

 It's a myth that we don't use parts of our brain.  We use it all,
 always.  It's just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most
 of us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  ""Lucid"" is
 a measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,
 but we only /choose/ Easy Rock 105.
 
 For example, don't look now but your shoes are full of feet.
 
 The sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a ""turning on""
 of circuits, it is a ""tuning in"".  The next step, of course, is to
 ""drop out"" :)
 
 To paraphrase an old saw: Life is wasted on the living.

    <font size=""3""><b>Why we're changing our publishing schedule</b></font>
 
 <br><br>
 
 Dear Reader,
 <p>
 As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
 <p>
 Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  
 <p>
 Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
 <p>
 Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
 <p>
 For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. 
 <p>
 I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=34-pJpSIcd8ldb3QT23_tvVyn4IcgyR"" >CNET Radio</a> every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
 <p>
 Sincerely,
 <p>
 
 David Coursey<br>
 Executive Editor<br>
 AnchorDesk

 Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening
 
 To all,
 
 I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa
 Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate
 IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.
 
 Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend
 the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen
 REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to
 hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am
 trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I
 would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print
 of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a
 theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to
 quickly set up a screening for its members.
 
 I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I
 originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of
 REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and
 none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  
 
 One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open
 Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another
 SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter
 to Hobbyists.  
 
 The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,
 but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open
 Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about
 the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a
 vegetarian.  
 
 I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects
 worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many
 aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary
 on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be
 punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by
 having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my
 feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you
 see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  
 
 I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing
 is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. 
 However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at
 home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a
 university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized
 screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I
 believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should
 retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement
 is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.
 
 One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of
 the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin
 selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a
 license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use
 the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the
 DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford
 to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of
 preserving the educational/institutional market.
 
 Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists
 that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the
 artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of
 REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. 
 It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked
 full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will
 get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek
 out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.
 
 I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for
 REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you
 will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested
 persons to legally view it.
 
 I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening
 at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 J.T.S. Moore
 Director, REVOLUTION OS

234,"2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -
 byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
 its parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where
 Tcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a ""pattern - body""
 strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
 a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The
 subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you
 the exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing
 correctly, and was arguably wrong before.
 
 2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in
 exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on
 exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.

 I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
 (unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
 a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.
 
 Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
 releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
 some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
 dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
 apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
 as the newest, thus being kept on the system.
 
 As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
 or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
 (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
 probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)

238,"I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
 ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
 recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
 of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
 intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
 not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
 if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
 There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
 early 1980s if not before.
 
 A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
 snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
 must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
 wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
 adequate.
 
 It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
 and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
 must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
 or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
 lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
 tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 
 
 BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
 writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
 I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
 to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
 not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
 there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
 may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
 recovery
 and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

 Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
 attacks
 
 
 Hi,
 
 I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
 base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
 image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
 changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
 incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
 current disk image for that specific virtual machine.
 
 This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
 honeypots mailing list)
 http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html
 
 Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
 applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
 even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.
 
 The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
 layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
 running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
 business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
 of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
 server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
 partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
 partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
 one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
 space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.
 
 When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
 shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
 Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
 what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
 ""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
 redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
 minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
 backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
 availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
 always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
 the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
 performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
 applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
 (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)
 
 Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
 been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
 I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
 this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
 systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
 non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
 ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
 no) downtime.
 
 Thanks for any opinions,
 Ben

 I have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day, constantly polling

 Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular email clients"".. As a

 How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham folder. Most email 
 clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to quickly move ""spam"" into the spam 
 folder. 
 
 Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete function) they can 
 quickly move ham into the ham folder.
 
 In either case, the message would be processed and then destroyed.

 DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
 ByScott Tyler Shafer
 August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
 
 DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
 specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
 process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
 hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
 according to company officials.
 
 The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a
 
 family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The
 
 DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
 called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
 data.
 
 According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
 conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
 proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
 businesses.
 
 ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
 ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
 
 Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up
 
 to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
 application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
 alternative.
 
 In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
 importance in the world of XML.
 
 ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
 said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
 Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
 
 Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
 security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
 
 According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
 processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company
 
 itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
 and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
 creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
 
 ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
 adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
 said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
 technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
 will be mostly false.
 Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
 accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,
 
 while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes
 
 and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
 
 The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of
 
 XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
 as they pass through the device.
 
 The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
 balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
 and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
 
 In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application
 
 co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
 control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
 controls the device.
 
 DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
 Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in
 
 May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
 focus on content processing and acceleration.
 The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
 company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
 field trails at a number of other enterprises.
 
 ========================================================================
 =
 
 DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
 founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
 foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
 would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
 grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
 designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
 requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
 interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
 is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
 
 Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
 developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
 and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
 industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
 
 Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
 network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
 Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of
 
 products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
 providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
 industry-leading customers and partners.
 
 DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
 brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,
 
 drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
 Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

 DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding
 
 Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer
 
 in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services
 
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
 leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
 that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
 this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
 Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
 and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of 
 Directors.
 
 DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and
 
 sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.
 
 Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML 
 networkingdevices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions
 
 at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
 and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on 
 its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.
 
 ""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
 intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
 prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
 DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
 XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
 applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
 Technology.
 
 ""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web
 
 services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single
 
 DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
 processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
 addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
 protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
 e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
 between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
 
 ""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
 laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
 a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
 Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
 DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
 free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
 performance and security pitfalls.""
 
 ""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly
 
 growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and

 I don't know whether it suggests that, but they would be tagged differently
 in to/cc if I were tagging them at all right now.  If I were tagging To:

 Funny as all hell.  So a group of 25 QUIT (Queers Undermining Israeli
 Terrorism) marched into the local starbucks in Berkeley (Of course,
 they pick a safe city like Berkeley, but hey, still funny) and
 'settle' driving away straights and other prior inhabitants with
 supersoakers :)
 
 Incredibly creative, in my opinion. Not terribly violent (I mean, how
 much damage can you -really-  do with a supersoaker?) but definintely
 a newscatcher.
 
 Its nice to see folks are finding some creative means to make a point.

 There's still MITM, but it requires a far higher capability, and is easier

 being manipulative in principle.
 
 If you run your own mailserver, or have a say in what your host does, make

 Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
 software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
 least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
 no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
 always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

 Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about 
 life on Earth today.
 
 The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy 
 that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in 
 an imperfect world.

 I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, 
 our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in 
 practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
 Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
 taking share from every other government broadcaster.
 
 It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
 as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.
 
 Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
 centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
 ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
 platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
 they might.
 
 As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make 
 as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
 about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
 might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
 our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
 overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
 how engaged we are in the world around us.
 
 Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
 globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 
 stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 
 the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.
 
 Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the 
 real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. 
 I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit 
 such a principle to be loosed upon the world.

 Full Text: Bush's National Security Strategy
 
 Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
 strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 
 United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
 the Administration's policy.
 
 INTRODUCTION
 
 THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
 totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
 freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
 democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
 nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
 guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
 potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
 everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 
 worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 
 property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
 are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
 protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
 freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.
 
 Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
 strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
 heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
 unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
 favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
 can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
 economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
 world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
 against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
 by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
 peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.
 
 Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
 commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
 dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
 industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
 individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
 than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
 penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
 against us.
 
 To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
 from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
 cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
 reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
 nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
 hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
 allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
 countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
 new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
 turn.
 
 The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
 and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
 weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
 so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
 succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
 means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
 contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
 technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
 will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
 cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
 be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
 and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
 saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
 entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.
 
 As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
 opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
 has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
 seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
 instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
 find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
 violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
 interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
 common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
 for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
 leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
 national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
 freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
 the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
 because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
 international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
 powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
 trade, and cultural advancement.
 
 Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
 the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
 the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
 every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
 that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
 national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
 into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
 corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
 drug cartels within their borders.
 
 The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
 better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
 trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
 out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
 nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
 build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
 The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
 the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
 invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
 continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
 AIDS and other infectious diseases.
 
 In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
 guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
 responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
 Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
 spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
 aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
 freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.
 
 We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
 better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
 the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
 to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
 Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
 other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
 these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
 are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
 rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.
 
 Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 
 every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
 been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 
 clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 
 it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
 holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
 these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
 this great mission.
 
 I. Overview of America's International Strategy
 
 
 ""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
 fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
 liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
 and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
 the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
 open societies on every continent.""

 The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
 and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
 liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
 unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
 strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
 favors freedom.
 
 For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
 struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
 equality.
 
 That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
 race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
 discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
 are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
 catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
 defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.
 
 This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
 translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
 and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
 distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
 values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
 make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
 progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
 with other states, and respect for human dignity.
 
 And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.
 
 To achieve these goals, the United States will:
 
 *	champion aspirations for human dignity;
 
 *	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
 attacks against us and our friends;
 
 *	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;
 
 *	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
 friends, with weapons of mass destruction;
 
 *	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
 free trade;
 
 *	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
 the infrastructure of democracy;
 
 *	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
 global power; and
 
 *	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
 challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.
 
 
 II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity
 
 
 ""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
 language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
 different methods, but not different moralities.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 West Point, New York
 June 1, 2002
 
 
 
 In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
 stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
 these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
 owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
 mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
 free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
 oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
 the secret police.
 
 America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
 dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; 
 free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 
 religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.
 
 These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
 us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
 facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
 core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
 been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
 aspirations of their people.
 
 Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
 our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
 Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
 stronger, but is a freer and more just society.
 
 Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
 when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
 and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
 we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
 the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
 America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
 evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
 cherish.
 
 Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
 the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
 these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.
 
 Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
 cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
 of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
 bodies.
 
 We will:
 
 *	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
 human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
 advance freedom;
 
 *	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
 struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
 democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;
 
 *	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
 themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
 from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
 to move toward a better future; and
 
 *	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
 and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.
 
 
 We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
 it.
 
 III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
 Attacks Against Us and Our Friends
 
 
 ""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
 the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
 clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
 waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
 peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
 the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
 our choosing.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
 September 14, 2001
 
 
 
 The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
 global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
 religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
 politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.
 
 In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
 lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
 within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
 States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
 with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
 knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.
 
 The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
 our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
 elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
 through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
 unseen.
 
 Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
 and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
 achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 
 forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
 only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
 trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
 America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.
 
 Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
 organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 
 control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 
 have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.
 
 We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
 coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
 campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
 the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
 tools necessary to finish the task.
 
 The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
 financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
 funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
 support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
 system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
 and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
 financial networks.
 
 However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
 cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
 seek.
 
 We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:
 
 *	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
 international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
 organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
 terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
 (WMD) or their precursors;
 
 *	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
 at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
 reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
 enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
 to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
 acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
 harm against our people and our country; and
 
 *	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
 by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
 responsibilities.
 
 
 We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
 terrorism. This includes:
 
 *	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
 with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
 illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
 slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
 can condone or support and all must oppose;
 
 *	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
 world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
 terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;
 
 *	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
 enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
 on areas most at risk; and
 
 *	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
 information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
 those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.
 
 
 While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
 strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
 attack.
 
 This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
 since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
 and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
 Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
 reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
 encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
 and the private sector.
 
 This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
 emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
 terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
 to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
 mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
 terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.
 
 While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
 in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
 Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
 and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
 governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
 will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
 our allies can provide.
 
 As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
 with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
 non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
 humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
 rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
 threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists
 
 In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
 ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
 and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
 conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
 productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
 ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
 
 IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts
 
 
 ""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
 The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
 look so small.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Berlin, Germany
 May 23, 2002
 
 
 
 Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
 disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
 an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
 alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
 horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
 falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
 alleviate suffering and restore stability.
 
 No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
 direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
 and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
 will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:
 
 *	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
 international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
 crises when they emerge.
 
 *	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
 those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
 people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.
 
 
 Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
 apply these principles:
 
 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
 human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
 of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
 to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
 for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
 to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
 peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
 government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
 counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
 parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
 comprehensive settlement to the conflict.
 
 The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
 stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
 development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
 establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
 Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
 corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
 for the creation of a Palestinian state.
 
 Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
 Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
 United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
 steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
 As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
 fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
 with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
 activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
 freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
 to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
 role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
 Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.
 
 In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
 and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
 time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
 Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
 constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
 Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
 choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
 open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
 become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
 and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
 involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
 bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
 that can help defuse military confrontation.
 
 Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
 respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
 the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
 employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
 neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
 Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.
 
 In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
 countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
 Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
 hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
 opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
 the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
 (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
 the entire hemisphere.
 
 Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
 from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
 and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
 security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
 strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
 their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
 drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
 in our own country.
 
 In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
 groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
 activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
 working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
 illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
 sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
 security to the Colombian people.
 
 In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
 and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
 States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
 combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
 therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
 African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
 Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
 fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
 borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 
 infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.
 
 An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 
 spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 
 of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 
 confronting these emerging transnational threats.
 
 Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 
 focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 
 administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 
 region:
 
 *	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 
 Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 
 and require focused attention;
 
 *	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 
 essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 
 operations; and
 
 *	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 
 must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 
 threats on a sustained basis.
 
 
 Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 
 surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 
 conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 
 waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 
 the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 
 common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 
 opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.
 
 V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 
 with Weapons of Mass Destruction
 
 
 ""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 
 technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 
 weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 
 even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 
 strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 
 have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 
 capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 
 we will oppose them with all our power.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 West Point, New York
 June 1, 2002
 
 
 
 The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 
 allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 
 force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 
 collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 
 environment has undergone profound transformation.
 
 Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 
 relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the 
 balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear 
 arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as 
 counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 
 inconceivable.
 
 But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 
 None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 
 that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 
 motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 
 destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 
 states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 
 destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 
 and dangerous.
 
 In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 
 states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 
 attributes. These states:
 
 *	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 
 for the personal gain of the rulers;
 
 *	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 
 and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;
 
 *	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 
 other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 
 to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;
 
 *	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and
 
 *	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 
 for which it stands.
 
 
 At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 
 designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 
 Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 
 weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 
 the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 
 increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 
 Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 
 well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 
 become a looming threat to all nations.
 
 We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 
 before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 
 against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 
 take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 
 partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 
 forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 
 missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 
 collection and analysis.
 
 Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:
 
 *	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 
 against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 
 capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 
 capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 
 homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 
 into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 
 our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 
 adversaries.
 
 *	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 
 terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 
 necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 
 arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 
 assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 
 necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 
 continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 
 increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 
 threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 
 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 
 forward.
 
 *	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 
 use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 
 WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 
 weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 
 enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 
 must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 
 forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.
 
 
 It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 
 this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 
 United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 
 in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 
 of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 
 caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 
 We cannot let our enemies strike first.
 
 *	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 
 faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 
 effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 
 retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 
 more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 
 the wealth of their nations.
 
 *	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 
 weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 
 used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 
 of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 
 military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 
 allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 
 allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 
 of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 
 of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.
 
 *	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 
 terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 
 targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 
 and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 
 states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 
 action.
 
 
 For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 
 an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 
 against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 
 and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 
 on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 
 mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.
 
 We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 
 objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 
 seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 
 fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 
 of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 
 and delivered covertly and without warning.
 
 The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 
 population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 
 of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 
 mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 
 these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 
 and used weapons of mass destruction.
 
 The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 
 to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 
 threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 
 the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 
 uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 
 forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 
 States will, if necessary, act preemptively.
 
 The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 
 threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 
 Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 
 the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 
 remain idle while dangers gather.
 
 We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 
 actions. To support preemptive options, we will:
 
 *	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 
 timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;
 
 *	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 
 most dangerous threats; and
 
 *	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 
 conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.
 
 
 The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 
 to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 
 actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.
 
 VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 
 Free Trade.
 
 
 ""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 
 privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 
 enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 
 better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 
 revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Monterrey, Mexico
 March 22, 2002
 
 
 
 A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 
 prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 
 supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 
 incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 
 economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 
 reinforces the habits of liberty.
 
 We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 
 shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 
 policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 
 economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 
 policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 
 growth, including:
 
 *	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 
 investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;
 
 *	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 
 improve incentives for work and investment;
 
 *	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 
 confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 
 endeavors;
 
 *	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 
 efficient use;
 
 *	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;
 
 *	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 
 skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and
 
 *	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 
 diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 
 opportunity.
 
 
 The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not 
 command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 
 best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 
 strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 
 all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 
 developing world.
 
 A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 
 national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 
 for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 
 of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 
 their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 
 Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 
 non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 
 use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 
 including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 
 are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 
 global economic growth.
 
 Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 
 growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 
 the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 
 markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 
 living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 
 world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 
 allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 
 their future.
 
 We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 
 access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 
 continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 
 markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 
 Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 
 Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 
 more effectively resolving them when they occur.
 
 The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 
 occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 
 so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 
 conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 
 achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 
 exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.
 
 The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it 
 became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 
 value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 
 that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 
 freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 
 trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:
 
 *	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 
 helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 
 especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 
 completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 
 accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 
 Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.
 
 *	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 
 in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 
 the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 
 States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 
 targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 
 government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 
 poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 
 allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 
 trade.
 
 *	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 
 free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 
 will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 
 Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 
 developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 
 Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 
 be our principal focal points.
 
 *	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 
 administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 
 Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 
 majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 
 Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 
 developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 
 work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 
 agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 
 Promotion Authority.
 
 *	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 
 policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 
 competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 
 societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 
 integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 
 developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 
 Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 
 produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 
 use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 
 to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 
 countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 
 the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 
 health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 
 flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 
 medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
 malaria.
 
 *	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 
 Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on 
 enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 
 disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 
 global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 
 that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 
 against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 
 community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 
 subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 
 undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.
 
 *	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 
 statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 
 in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 
 American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 
 enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 
 the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 
 workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 
 change and dynamism of open markets.
 
 *	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 
 economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 
 widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 
 concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" 
 between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 
 International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 
 talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.
 
 *	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 
 and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 
 allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 
 types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 
 Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 
 work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 
 technologies.
 
 
 Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 
 greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 
 them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 
 global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 
 gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 
 emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 
 years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 
 to:
 
 *	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 
 international cooperation;
 
 *	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 
 the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 
 companies that can show real cuts;
 
 *	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 
 reductions;
 
 *	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 
 well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 
 while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;
 
 *	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 
 a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 
 by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 
 budget; and
 
 *	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 
 emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 
 resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 
 better path.
 
 
 VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 
 the Infrastructure of Democracy
 
 
 ""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 
 rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 
 must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
 Development Bank)
 March 14, 2002
 
 
 
 A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
 race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 
 all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 
 opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 
 U.S. international policy.
 
 Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 
 growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 
 to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 
 perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 
 spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 
 achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.
 
 Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 
 failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 
 for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 
 the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.
 
 This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 
 of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 
 impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 
 implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 
 of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 
 set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's 
 poorest economies within a decade.
 
 The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 
 achieve this goal:
 
 *	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 
 national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 
 development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 
 present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 
 these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 
 Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 
 in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 
 corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 
 in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 
 enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 
 countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 
 that have not to implement reforms.
 
 *	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 
 banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 
 comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 
 multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 
 the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 
 contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 
 contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 
 World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 
 Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 
 poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 
 in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 
 development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 
 productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 
 and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 
 must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 
 developing countries.
 
 *	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 
 assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 
 poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 
 more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 
 health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 
 better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 
 the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 
 results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 
 development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 
 development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 
 achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
 replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 
 system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 
 donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 
 achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 
 contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 
 World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 
 progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 
 that these institutions do.
 
 *	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 
 the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 
 is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 
 particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 
 ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
 agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 
 poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 
 sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 
 by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 
 banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 
 sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 
 development projects that show results.
 
 *	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 
 the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 
 most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 
 foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 
 as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 
 security strategy.
 
 *	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 
 countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 
 like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 
 threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 
 developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 
 governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 
 local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 
 global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
 and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 
 treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 
 twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 
 global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.
 
 *	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 
 democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 
 are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 
 will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 
 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 
 training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 
 technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 
 devastated by AIDS.
 
 *	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 
 including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 
 in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 
 Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 
 to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 
 suffer from hunger and malnutrition.
 
 
 VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 
 of Global Power
 
 
 ""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 
 century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 
 of prepare for war.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 West Point, New York
 June 1, 2002
 
 
 
 America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 
 broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 
 of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 
 clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 
 consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.
 
 There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 
 accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 
 and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 
 strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the 
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 
 inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 
 security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 
 trade.
 
 The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 
 recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 
 first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 
 transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 
 new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 
 circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 
 highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 
 respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.
 
 The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 
 creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 
 mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:
 
 *	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 
 able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;
 
 *	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 
 combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;
 
 *	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 
 effective multinational fighting forces;
 
 *	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 
 scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 
 they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;
 
 *	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 
 meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 
 training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; 
 and
 
 *	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 
 we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.
 
 
 If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 
 partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 
 states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 
 perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 
 take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 
 same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 
 foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 
 close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 
 cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 
 transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.
 
 The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 
 Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 
 attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 
 dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 
 Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 
 levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 
 attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 
 alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 
 invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.
 
 The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 
 not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 
 ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 
 friendships, we will:
 
 
 *	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 
 global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 
 close defense and diplomatic cooperation;
 
 *	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 
 preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 
 the region over the longer-term;
 
 *	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 
 continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 
 we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;
 
 *	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 
 allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 
 environment; and
 
 *	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 
 institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
 forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 
 change in this dynamic region.
 
 
 We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 
 competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 
 internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 
 three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 
 global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.
 
 With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 
 on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and 
 Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 
 Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 
 critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 
 long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 
 States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 
 country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 
 needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 
 Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 
 Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.
 
 United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 
 refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 
 challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 
 global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 
 World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 
 promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 
 created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 
 cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 
 continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 
 former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 
 neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 
 into the Euro-Atlantic community.
 
 At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 
 divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 
 build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 
 motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 
 relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 
 democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 
 of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 
 weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 
 opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 
 decades.
 
 The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 
 relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 
 require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 
 democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 
 government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 
 have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 
 the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 
 in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.
 
 Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 
 and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 
 while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 
 India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 
 which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 
 with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 
 future.
 
 The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 
 strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 
 region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 
 China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 
 Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 
 features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 
 next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 
 In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 
 neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 
 path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 
 greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 
 the only source of that greatness.
 
 The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 
 China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 
 the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 
 peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 
 and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 
 similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 
 such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 
 welfare of our citizens.
 
 Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 
 more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 
 and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 
 political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 
 village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 
 one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 
 accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 
 remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 
 assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.
 
 Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 
 the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 
 opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 
 and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 
 $100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 
 the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 
 openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 
 protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 
 areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 
 self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 
 rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 
 commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 
 not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.
 
 The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 
 relations between the United States and other main centers of global 
 power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 
 in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 
 must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 
 become routine and unproductive.
 
 Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 
 can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 
 analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 
 that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open 
 the path of progress.
 
 IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 
 Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century
 
 
 ""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 
 its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 
 and enterprise of our people.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
 September 20, 2001
 
 
 
 The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 
 different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 
 transformed.
 
 It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 
 We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 
 highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 
 our military must:
 
 *	assure our allies and friends;
 
 *	dissuade future military competition;
 
 *	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and
 
 *	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.
 
 
 The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 
 forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 
 strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 
 confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 
 deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 
 how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 
 occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 
 challenges.
 
 The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 
 symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 
 willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 
 the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 
 power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 
 many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 
 and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 
 well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 
 of U.S. forces.
 
 Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 
 planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 
 across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 
 of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 
 developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 
 strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 
 This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 
 ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 
 U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 
 infrastructure and assets in outer space.
 
 Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 
 approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 
 intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 
 technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 
 run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 
 Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 
 the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 
 wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 
 coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.
 
 We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from 
 experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 
 and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 
 whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 
 States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 
 sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 
 will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 
 military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 
 United States.
 
 Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 
 against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 
 around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 
 fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 
 with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 
 targets.
 
 We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 
 keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 
 appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 
 and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 
 capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 
 knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 
 the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 
 to maximize injury.
 
 We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 
 integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 
 the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 
 inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 
 information between intelligence and law enforcement.
 
 Initiatives in this area will include:
 
 *	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 
 to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 
 capabilities;
 
 *	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 
 seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 
 the nation and our allies;
 
 *	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 
 sustain our intelligence advantage;
 
 *	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 
 through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 
 capabilities; and
 
 *	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 
 government with all-source analysis.
 
 
 As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 
 America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 
 nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 
 sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 
 Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 
 other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 
 be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 
 and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 
 international politics must also extend their reach to understand 
 complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 
 health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.
 
 Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 
 wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 
 requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 
 police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 
 government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 
 cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 
 readiness to play our part.
 
 Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 
 to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 
 public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 
 about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 
 civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 
 a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 
 and this is an area where America must excel.
 
 We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 
 our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 
 by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 
 International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 
 to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 
 other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 
 cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 
 agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 
 implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 
 provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 
 personnel and officials.
 
 We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 
 right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 
 The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 
 war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 
 the American people.
 
 Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 
 diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 
 a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 
 and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 
 our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 
 vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 
 bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 
 As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 
 until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 
 is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 
 of it.
 
 In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 
 interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 
 apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 
 disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 
 our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow 
 such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with 
 our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.
 
 Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the 
 skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of 
 our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, 
 entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that 
 energy. That is where our national security begins.

 Everything else :)  I can't even mark text in an exmh message window

 And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually

 Limbo seems to be able to compile its own kernel with its own gcc 3.1. 
 That said, I don't want to know what kind of patches Redhat are applying 
 to that kernel. The .spec file alone is 128KBytes! One of the patches is 
 2.4.19-ac10. Redhat don't seem to have patched Limbo's gcc too heavily.

265,"Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in
 many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
 is effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
 state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current
 folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file
 more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can
 stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.
 
 Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
 We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
 Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks""
 (high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
 clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
 relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
 delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
 the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.

 Look at my friend Jonathan's company, VOXEO.  Unless you're going 
 to run out and build a platform that executes Voice XML code and 
 can support IMAP etc. then the easiest way to do this is to 
 leverage VOXEO's service.  You can start building on it for free 
 and you will pay > $0.10 per minute for the pleasure of 
 using/testing the service.
 
 http://www.voxeo.com
 
 If you have about $50K to throw at the project then you can look at 
 NUANCE, which has a platform that combines VoiceXML/VXML, Speech 
 Reco, and the L&H speech synthesize, which will allow you to have 
 your email read to you by Stephen Hawking.
 
 TellMe & BeVocal have off-the-shelf services that do this, though, 
 but from my testing, they suck.
 
 If I were to build this I'd spec a lightweight IMAP client and 
 VoiceXML browser and dump them on VOXEO.
 
 However, you'll find this to be extremely slow and frustrating.  
 Better to us a screen phone with a WAP client.

 If you said mind-numbing, rights destroying, cynic-making force, I'd
 agree.  But, does politics really kill?
 
 I'm bitter atm.  Two reasons mostly:
 1) I was listening to what I heard being the First Amendment
 Foundation? on NPR releasing a poll noting that their
 very-unscientific poll found that half the population thinks the first
 amendment goes too far.   And (their quote was 1 in 5, but I'm finding
 sources of 1 in 4) of the population don't even know what rights are
 guaranteed in the first amendment.
 
 2) I have a paper due that will make or break my law school career.  I
 hate being a forced sheep.

269,"Hi,
 
 	I'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. 
 I think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd's, worked just 
 fine, but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms, it won't 
 anymore. 
 The output is :
 
 input_dvd: Sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted DVDs. The legal status
            of CSS decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.
            Please check http://dvd.sf.net for more information.
 
 I'm pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release... Any way of 
 rolling back updates ?

 Microsoft has released a media player for its Xbox game
   console that allows you to play movies recorded on CDs in the
   DivX format.
   <p>True or false? Put your answer in the subject of an e-mail and send it to  
   <A HREF=""mailto:coolgear@cnet.com?subject=slim"">coolgear@cnet.com</A>.
   <p>
   Answer to the question from the last newsletter:
   <p>
   Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
   Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
   watch while you're on the go.
   <p>
   No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
   ""home-entertainment features"" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
   out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
   proposed such a feature.

 This time the problem seems to be that I overestimated xine-lib's configure
 script as it seems that it doesn't support disabling arts... so if you have
 arts-devel installed, its support will be compiled in :-/
 
 Also, I had made another mistake and added the configure option to disable

 There are several issues here.
 
 (1) For reasons that have nothing to do with
 commercial advertising, we need email software that
 prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez. We
 simply can't continue down the path where every
 script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can
 cause millions or billions of dollars worth of
 damage.
 
 (2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the
 point that digital signatures are the standard way
 to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging
 your machine or otherwise compromising your private
 key will be the only way that someone can forge a
 message from you. I don't see any reason that email
 software that automatically uses digital signatures
 for contact management and whitelisting would be
 any more expensive than existing email clients.
 Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
 on it.
 
 (3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
 with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
 nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
 parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George
 Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
 I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
 private key should should fall into that category.

 Hmmm... I don't see any :-)
 
 My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
 Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
 upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
 Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for
 me) ;-)
 Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
 wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a
 secondary rebuild system.

 The Bug Count Also Rises
 
 
 by John Browne
 (Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)
 
 In the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves 
 of the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles 
 drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then 
 later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.
 
 Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles 
 and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.
 
 Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came 
 to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were 
 not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in 
 Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you 
 thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the 
 floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they 
 ate at you.
 
 When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. ""The RAID is huge 
 with bugs,"" Hernando said. ""The bugs are infinite.""
 
 ""Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.""
 
 ""Once you were great with the bugs,"" Hernando said. ""No one was 
 greater,"" he said again. ""Even Prado.""
 
 ""Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.""
 
 Hernando shrugged. ""Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in 
 Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.""
 
 ""Herb tea?""
 
 ""It is true, my friend."" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his 
 office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.
 
 Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for 
 awhile, then he asked Michaels, ""I need you to triage for me.""
 
 Michaels looked down. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said.
 
 ""This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.""
 
 ""I'm finished with that,"" Michaels said again. ""I just want to live 
 quietly.""
 
 ""Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only 
 drink herb tea.""
 
 ""Herb tea?"" Michaels said.
 
 ""It is true,"" he said sorrowfully.
 
 Michaels stood up. ""Then I will do it, my friend,"" he said formally. ""I 
 will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for 
 the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time 
 Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them 
 with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all 
 the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.""
 
 Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they 
 walked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried 
 the bodies back from the meetings.

 Using satellites to monitor global climate change

 SUMMARY
 
 As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.
 
 The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.
 
 Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
 
 
 
 GATHERING THE DATA
 
 While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.
 
 The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.
 
 Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.
 
 
 
 VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS
 
 A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.
 
 To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.
 
 He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054 Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.
 
 ""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""
 
 The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28 Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23 Fahrenheit) per decade.
 
 Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.
 
 ""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""
 
 Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.
 
 While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.
 
 In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05 C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.
 
 
 
 GLOBAL COVERAGE
 
 One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.
 
 The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.
 
 The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.
 
 Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.
 
 The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.
 
 Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.
 
 While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.
 
 Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.
 
 In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU
 
 With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.
 
 Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.
 
 Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)
 
 To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS
 
 Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY
 
 While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.
 
 The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.
 
 Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.
 
 
 
 THE SCIENTISTS
 
 In 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""
 
 AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.
 
 In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.
 
 
 
 DR. JOHN CHRISTY
 
 Christy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.
 
 He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign, IL, 1983-87, an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, 1981-82, and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College, 1980-81.
 
 He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion, S.D., 1978-82, and as science master at Baptist High School, Nyeri, Kenya, 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.
 
 Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center, and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an ""invited key contributor"" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change, and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.
 
 
 
 DR. ROY SPENCER
 
 Spencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison, WI, in 1981, after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC, 1984-87, before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.
 
 He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues. Spencer is lead author on sixteen scientific papers.

 I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.
 
 Now that I have I'm trying to resolve ""breakage"" and differences.
 
 The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
 window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
 window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
 was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
 window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
 mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
 1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.
 
 As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
 more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
 more room than I can ""spare"".
 
 I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
 certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
 window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.
 
 One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
 click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the
 sequences in the ""always show"" list.  And of course a way to 
 expand it back.

      Advisory: Remote Compromise/DOS Vulnerability in PHP
  Release Date: 2002/07/22
 Last Modified: 2002/07/22
        Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]
 
   Application: PHP 4.2.0, 4.2.1
      Severity: A vulnerability within the multipart/form-data handler
                could allow remote compromise of the web server.
          Risk: Critical
 Vendor Status: Patches Released.
     Reference: http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/022002.html
 
 
 
 Overview:
 	
    We have discovered a serious vulnerability within the default version 
    of PHP. Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a 
    remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server. 
  
 	
 Details:
 
    PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST 
    handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer
    i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed. 
    A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not
    correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit-
    ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers.
    When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers
    that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation
    those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous
    function calls. 
 
    On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what
    will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All 
    possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP
    will crash when it tries to free them.
 
    Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a
    solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free
    chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably
    the case for several more non IA32 architectures.
 
    Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are
    running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable
    to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory
    managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to
    overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses.
    
 
 Proof of Concept:
 
    e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to
    the public.
    
 
 Vendor Response:
 
    22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this 
                     vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at:
 
                        http://www.php.net/downloads.php
 
                     The vendor announcement is available at:
 
                        http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php
 
 
 Recommendation:
 
    If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible,
    especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade
    for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all
    kinds of POST requests on your server.

 I'm not sure what you're doing, but suspect you're storing individual
 WordInfo pickles.  If so, most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to
 that, and doesn't happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance
 directly.

 I'm not interested in optimizing anything yet, and get many benefits from
 the *ease* of working with utterly vanilla Python instance objects.  Lots of
 code all over picks these apart for display and analysis purposes.  Very few
 people have tried this code yet, and there are still many questions about it
 (see, e.g., Jeremy's writeup of his disappointing first-time experiences
 today).  Let's keep it as easy as possible to modify for now.  If you're
 desparate to save memory, write a subclass?
 
 Other people are free to vote in other directions, of course <wink>.

 Classic X copy-and-paste behavior is that you can only paste what is
 currently highlighted.  In fact, it is the act of highlighting a
 selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.  X has
 no ""copy"" command -- if you highlighted it, you just copied it.
 
 > This does not seem to override what is in an application's own

 If ab application has a ""copy"" command that you can choose to use
 separately from the process of highlighting something, that command
 is something the application authors wrote on their own.  (And it it
 likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
 also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
 work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
 functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
 functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
 are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

 Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.
 
 Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
 this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.

 OK, here's a refinement.  Assuming very little spam comes through, we
 only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
 ham to match the new training spam.  The program could randomly select
 a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
 validate this selection.  You could do this once a day or week (config
 parameter).

 I'm trying to think about the end-user issues because I have nothing
 to contribute to the algorithm at this point.  For deployment we need
 both!

 It seemed that way to me when I ripped the classifier out of it -- I don't

 Someone else will have to answer that (I don't use GBayes or hammie, at

 That's been done now, right?

 Those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they're
 interesting.  The tiny spam/ham collections in GBayes are also worthless
 now.  The ""self test"" feature didn't do anything except print its results;
 Tester.py since became doctest'ed and verifies that some basic machinery
 actually delivers what it's supposed to deliver.

302,"Well, I tried the Ximian GNOME 2.0 packages from
 http://apt.sunnmore.net, and have to say, it was a let-down.  Ran
 'apt-get update' , 'apt-get install gnome-session' then 'apt-get
 upgrade' and Nautilus failed to execute, couldn't get any help docs to
 come up, along with more problems.  So, with the luck of 'rpm -qa|grep
 ximian' then removing by hand all ximian packages with 'rpm -e --nodeps'
 and reinstalling everything GNOME and GNOME-related with apt, I got
 trusty old Red Hat 7.3 GNOME back on the desktop, and the only trace of
 Ximian is Evolution, again, thanks to apt from this site.
 
 I really liked Ximian (back then, Helix ?) at first but, to me, Red
 Hat's GNOME, released with 7.3 seems much more pretty and up-to-date. 
 Could this be because of inclusion of gtk2 in RH 7.3?

 I made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
 card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
 hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
 webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
 more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
 but all in all a smooth move.
 
 
 Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
 funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
 essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
 goofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
 the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
 11mbs and at least 60% goodness.
 
 
 Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
 inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
 microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
 cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
 thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
 hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )
 
 Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
 by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
 heading this way....DUCKKKKK

 I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
 exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
 misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
 above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.
 
 If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
 like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
 first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
 that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
 more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
 resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
 less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.

 It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
 on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
 is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
 should be 755).
 
 If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=yes""
 in the procmailrc. :)

 As I mentioned in my email to Anders, it's certainly in my code and I don't 
 have time to work on it right now, so I would not be offended if you worked on 
 it.
 
 I just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be 
 done before my vacation that will require my efforts, so it's even more true 
 that it was when I sent the mail to Anders.

 Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2
 
 
 Folks,
 
 my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.
 
 
 Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
 disk
 for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
 went
 fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
 I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
 GeForce4
 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
 default
 set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
 RPM.
 Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
 but
 it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
 Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
 twice,
 the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
 is
 inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
 If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
 I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
 Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
 Opinions
 welcome.
 
 Thanks a lot,
 Peter

 Hash: SHA1
 
 Say 'amen' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.
 
 
 The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,
 expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at
 the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good""
 of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else
 to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized
 crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest
 nation.
 
 Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago
 have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally
 irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in
 government.
 
 As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly
 usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will
 be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and
 special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the
 cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize
 to such perfection.
 
 
 All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded
 by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not
 religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.
 *Commerce*.
 
 
 If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites
 who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects
 on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called
 ""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the
 highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,
 foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.
 
 If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for
 a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the
 families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the
 property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the
 event.
 
 And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as
 tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square
 feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.
 
 
 In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic
 internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially
 decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,
 economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition
 and statism.
 
 It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower
 Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but
 it's going to happen sooner or later.
 
 And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who
 died at the World Trade Center.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

 REVIEW & OUTLOOK
 
 A Living Memorial
 
 As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the
 six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone
 else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who
 died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who
 perished would be a living one.
 
 The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,
 especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of
 heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of
 the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were
 attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best
 expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be
 to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries
 working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of
 productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin
 Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.
 
 But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has
 been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous
 rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the
 Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and
 scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now
 clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,
 and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance
 to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.
 
 This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out
 what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor
 George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November
 re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the
 memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the
 commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space
 for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning
 to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so
 successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for
 an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.
 
 A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's
 anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They
 want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas
 - -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have
 had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in
 New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World
 Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are
 cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own
 anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One
 family group even called a press conference to reject as
 disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.
 
 We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident
 that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center
 isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great
 cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all
 rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban
 life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port
 city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a
 statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.
 
 In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to
 be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were
 affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,
 you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary
 War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World
 War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it
 disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on
 around the walls containing their names.
 
 In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the
 emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.
 Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres
 devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures
 on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would
 severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised
 his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the
 press and has since ducked for cover.
 
 Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe
 those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking
 more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best
 way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.

 The restrictive law regarding audio is actually the accumulated cruft of
 30 years of various legislative acts. The totality of what we have now
 come from various parts of all the following re: sound recordings:
 
 1998 - DMCA
 1995 - Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act
 1992 - Audio Home Recording Act
 1976 - Copyright Act amendment
 1972 - Copyright Act amendment
 
 It is worth noting that many people have forgotten about the 1976
 Copyright Act Amendment which created the foundational law stating that
 the copyright owners have the right to limit personal use of audio
 recordings after First Sale even if you are not ""making copies"" in any
 commercial sense.  Sound recordings, for many intents and purposes, are
 explicitly excluded from Fair Use by the 1976 amendment.

 The point could also be to hassle the sunbather for reasons not given in
 the story.  The sunbather has probably pissed off the complainers in other

 And, as always, you can take a page out of Fight Club and start showing up
 at all sorts of support groups. Look what it did for Marla and Jack...
 
 ""JACK You can't have *both* parasites. You take blood parasites and --
 MARLA I want brain parasites.
 She opens another dryer and does the same thing again. PG 19
 JACK Okay. I'll take blood parasites and I'll take organic brain dementia
 and --
 MARLA I want that.
 JACK You can't have the whole brain!
 MARLA So far, you have four and I have two!
 JACK Well, then, take blood  parasites. Now, we each have three.
 MARLA So, we each have three -- that's six. What  about the seventh day? I
 want ascending bowel cancer.
 JACK *I* want ascending bowel cancer.
 MARLA That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, huh?
 JACK We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
 MARLA Deal.""

 I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_macintosh.html"">Mac OS X Tips</a> is in publication 
 and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have 
 appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means 
 getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've 
 written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, 
 I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will 
 find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things 
 on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.
 <p>
 Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing 
 sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the 
 contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is 
 truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and 
 Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which 
 will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be 
 primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom 
 of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. 
 If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the 
 sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris 
 and Randy.

 I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months 
 and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going 
 to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what 
 your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with 
 some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting 
 topics. Either way, I'm open to some

 <a class=""url"" href=""http://www.searchstandard.com/"">http://www.searchstandard.com/</a><p>
 
 
 While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning 
 off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the 
 preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local 
 machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on 
 search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of 
 SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it 
 possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site 
 won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make 
 finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, 
 that much easier.

 Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like 
 intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those 
 services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark 
 when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. 
 The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, 
 ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service 
 verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your 
 local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending 
 you a message when those services go down. The interface allows 
 for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail 
 account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via 
 a sound from your machine.

 For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you 
 need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly 
 useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely 
 different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions 
 relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the 
 Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From 
 the command line type:
 <p>
 sudo chown username filename
 <p>
 You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for 
 username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will 
 replace filename.

 Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a 
 particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of 
 the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" 
 related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store 
 information on recently made changes to a file, information from others 
 who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers 
 and other pertinent data you may need when dealing with tech support.

 An example:  Being able to model RF propagation in three dimensions for a
 metro area when deploying wireless networks.  By having every single tree
 and building detail and similar, you can ""see"" even tiny dead spots due to
 physical blockage and signal attenuation.  Overlay this with fiber map data
 for yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is
 also useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling
 existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further
 deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.  Take that and tie it into a
 slick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and management
 system and you've really got something...
 
 For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate.

 government-proposed remedies can""t adequately address this

   <b>Oracle challenges Microsoft anew</b></a></font><br>
 
 Oracle is taking on Microsoft's Exchange with a <b>Collaboration Suite</b> that includes e-mail, calendar and messaging software. Oracle has pitched its products as Microsoft replacements before -- with spectacularly little success. (At Comdex last November, the database giant offered its 9i and app-server software as a more secure <b>alternative to Exchange</b>.) What's different this time? Oracle is selling a separate collaboration product that, says CEO <b>Larry Ellison</b>, is cheaper than rival offerings. Plus: Companies facing a deadline to join Redmond's new <b>licensing program</b> may be more open to non-Micrososft alternatives.

 demands of Web services require securing information at
 the application level.

324,"I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem 
 we have at my house:
 
 We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our 
 house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years 
 and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the 
 people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me 
 that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the 
 account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we 
 could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the 
 account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years 
 and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the 
 lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And 
 eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the 
 account representatives and billing people and their managers and their 
 managers' managers ad naseum.
 
 The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix 
 the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when 
 it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked 
 ""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them 
 back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to 
 the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at 
 them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. 
 Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which 
 they seem all too happy to do.
 
 At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a 
 lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.
 
 Perplexed,
 Elias

 yep, that's what i learned as it seemed more useful then the other

 if i go to a class, i'm there to learn.  if they throw in anthems or
 politics, i'll take what i can learn from that and i'll take in a new
 perspective, but i'll only do that with my critical thinking cap on.
 just like i do when i watch mass media.  and yes, from the one irish
 course i took in dublin, they do the national anthem.  which is fine
 really - i started off each day in school in america with the pledge of
 allegience (with the under god bit in it which annoyed my dad to no end).
 if that sort of thing didn't stick at the age of five, i severely doubt
 it will stick now.

 and see, that would be my retort to any overly zealous irish speaker.
 there's a huge opportunity for a fully irish computing environment in
 free software.  and yet i don't see much action from official irish
 organisations.  the reason mandrake and some others have the irish
 support they have is because of individuals like donnacha.

 There's a brief discussion of this before the definition of
 MAX_DISCRIMINATORS.  All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are
 saved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.
 Then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of
 clues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)
 is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of
 them.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final
 probability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list
 of clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;
 and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual
 review is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer
 MAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that's
 why you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.
 
 Before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and
 0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened to
 appear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.

 I just beat it <wink>:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores
 punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word
 bigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a
 list of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!  Yikes.

 No matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.
 Ditto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique ""words"" that get
 0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of
 conditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the
 probability that ""<body>"" appears in a message is highly correlated with the
 prob of ""<br>"" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayes
 grossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you
 get in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>.
 
 Read the ""What about HTML?"" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,
 I've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at
 python.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to
 justify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven't done anything
 geared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email
 that happens to go through python.org.
 
 I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it
 still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test
 results with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the ""What about
 HTML?"" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,
 
 # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
 # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.
 
 and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n rate
 reductions.  I should test that again now.
 
 > Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
 
 Almost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both
 headers and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base
 tokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.
 
 > Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make

 I would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailman
 header decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging
 the data is a Mortal Sin and I haven't changed a byte so far), and my spam
 too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  In
 particular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they're
 going to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don't even catch
 ""undisclosed recipients"" in the To header now!).

 Ah!  That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped.  I'd again offer
 to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped here
 too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like
 a loss <wink>.

 I reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from
 my corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting
 on sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error
 rates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of
 each.
 
 
 Ah, a full test run just finished, on the
 
    tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips
 a
    trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams
 
 This is the code:
 
             # Tokenize everything in the body.
             lastw = ''
             for w in word_re.findall(text):
                 n = len(w)
                 # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().
                 if 3 <= n <= 12:
                     if w[-1] == 's':
                         w = w[:-1]
                     yield w
                     if lastw:
                         yield lastw + w
                     lastw = w + ' '
 
                 elif n >= 3:
                     lastw = ''
                     for t in tokenize_word(w):
                         yield t
 
 where
 
     word_re = re.compile(r""[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+"")
 
 This at least doubled the process size over what's done now.  It helped the
 f-n rate significantly, but probably hurt the f-p rate (the f-p rate is too
 low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small
 *absolute* magnitude -- 0.025% is a single message in the f-p table):

 Well Beberg, unless you're really into Anime and actually hold true

 which is probably related to my not having an ""unseen"" sequence anywhere
 (certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
 tried this new exmh ...
 
 Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
 which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
 that with.   There's obviously a way as the ""Sequences"" menu does this.
 The ""Mark Unseen"" menu entry in the message ""More"" menu is still wanting
 that function as well...
 
   | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
   | display the other sequences.
 
 Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
 in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
 folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
 top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...
 
 I have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they
 remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
 ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
 off the bottom, and not be shown).
 
 I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
 just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
 background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
 other decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the
 folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
 root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
 and do I can see when new mail needs processing).
 
 I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
 in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
 the ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a
 preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
 would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
 folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
 This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
 productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
 in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
 it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
 packed, sorted, etc).
 
 I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
 next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
 bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"".
 It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
 happens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful
 (to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
 which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is
 clumsy that way)
 
 Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
 in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
 list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...

 It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject
 to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
 Looks as if something is now saying ""1 hit"" when before it didn't, or
 similar.
 
   | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
   | week or so ago.
 
 Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
 Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
 more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
 the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).
 
 Hope this helps.

 Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
 Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
 shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
 before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
 them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
 non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
 is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
 And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
 should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
 really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.

 blogged the hell out of the talk: 
 
     Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
     roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), 
     ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax 
     case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would 
     not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the 
     VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the 
     case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a 
     technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. 
     This principle is under attack. 
 
     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright 
     measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits 
     distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content 
     scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, 
     override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial 
     for creating a piece of code.

 Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
 e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
 it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
 Outlook.

 When we get more (good) ""nice"" tests, the GA will assign lower
 scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are
 very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
 of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
 problem to solve.

 That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
 meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
 time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
 version available.
 
 'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

 It places the company, corporate network and data at risk.
 
 Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more
 being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places
 other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company
 reputation and liability with customers at risk, and
 proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably
 expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that
 Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence
 and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned.

 I don't use custom sequences, so I can't comment well.  I suspect that
 you'd have to use a cron job to maintain the sequences.

 Nope.  I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
 exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis
 SSH X11 forwarding).  In fact, your message was read and replied to
 (this message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home
 machine.

 Basic electronic organizers they're not, but if you're searching 
 for a pocket-sized computer for music, movies, and games, then 
 these PDAs are well worth a look. All four models feature fast 
 processors, large amounts of RAM, and sharp, color screens, which 
 make them better choices for rich media than competing products. 
 But beyond those basics, these handhelds are very different. You'll 
 find three different operating systems: Pocket PC, Palm, and Linux. 
 Two have keyboards, one has a built-in Bluetooth radio, and all 
 four support various expansion card formats. Most Pocket PCs are 
 multimedia friendly; we've picked two that really stand out because 
 of features or price. However, none of these are inexpensive models, 
 so check out our hands-on reviews to find the high-end handheld 
 that you'll be happiest with.

 I can copy the RedHat official download ISO's. I can't
 call it redhat if I sell it, so I can give you copies
 of thread linux 7.3 if you want.
 
 Failing that, I have the 7 CD's from Woody (Debian 3.0).
 Otheriwse, you need to find  a different source.

 Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
 boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
 Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
 some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
 networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
 networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs <a href=3D""http://c=
 lickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D76-vJf7InBP3QcLqhr1okYP2r70U6iR"" ><B>doing
 something about it</b></a>. And what
 about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
 Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
 these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, <a href=3D""http://clickthru.onlin=
 e.com/Click?q=3D8b-SBGBQY0y_2bkiJ1EYIEElDh4B1FR"" ><B>show you how</b></a>.

 <font size=3D""-1"">
 Big broadband providers are ticked off about Wi-Fi hot spots.
 In fact, both AT&amp;T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun

 <font size=3D""-1"">
 Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard
 about security issues, but should you count on their skills to

 hands and shows you how to protect yourself.

 akitogo is happy to announce that Jochen Becker has just finished a small
 nice PHP interface which integrates Spammassassin in the webuser interface
 from Communigate.
 
 It currently tested with RedHat,PHP and CGPro
 
 What is does:
 -------------
 The users are able to:
 - edit the blacklist and whitelist
 - edit required hits (score)
 - define a mailbox in which every spam mail is dropped
 
 Spamassassin settings made by the webinterfaxe are handled domain wide.
 
 You can download it from:

 Mutt interacts with smtpdaemon or something like that doesn't it?
 
 Can mutt interact directly with SMTP server with authentication
 capabilities? I don't think it can. 
 
 Surely you can just run a mailserver on your own machine and send
 mail using it?

 	It's still quite easy to find out, pre-purchase, what components if
 any are going to give you problems with a specific distribution/version.
 With Dell just check the support.dell.com site, match the system, look for
 downloadable drivers. From these if there aren't any linux drivers you can
 usually find out the chipset of each device. Plug them into google with
 ""linux"" and see what people have to say about them. Generally speaking when
 you buy the system you'll be told the make/model of each device rather than
 the chipset, so further investigation is necessary.
 
 	The cavaet, of course, is always to know exactly what you're buying.
 In most people's cases unfortunately it's not the person who bought the
 systems that will be configuring them.

 Linux Beer Hike will be in Doolin this year. We'd be intrested

 Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
 boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
 Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
 some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
 networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
 networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs <a href=3D""http://c=

 Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
 these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, <a href=3D""http://clickthru.onlin=

 Big broadband providers are ticked off about Wi-Fi hot spots.
 In fact, both AT&amp;T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun

 others at no charge. Also this week: we review Yahoo""s new
 dial-up service.

 Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard
 about security issues, but should you count on their skills to

 hands and shows you how to protect yourself.

 I think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database
 is key to decentralization. 
 
 Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.
 Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency
   by have some play with time and value
 Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's
   called congnitive dissonance theory
 Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale
   and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.
 
 I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.
 decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround
 from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way
 inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by 
 protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. 
 The local information when combined with the technical
 troubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronization
 to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.
 enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when
 concerns are more immedidate.  
 
 Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how
 people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily
 pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck
 who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the
 whole world would be a little more perfect and everything,
 including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently
 be in its proper place.

 OTOH, look into DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse,
 http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/), which uses fuzzy checksums.
 It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than
 something any of us would throw together for personal use (no offense,
 Skip!).  But I have no personal experience of it.

378,"Hello People,
 
 I am new to SA but (2) problems I do have.
 
 I run SA from my own home for personal use and it seems to work but I see this
 in my procmail log:
 
 
 <cut>
 procmail: Executing "" ~/bin/SpamAssassin/spamassassin -P -c ~/bin/SpamAssassin/rules""
 dccproc: not found
 dccproc: not found
 <cut>
 
 Can someone enlighten me on why I get that? FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE, SA-2.3.0
 
 
 
 Secondly, I've tested (now on Three boxes) SA for site-wide usage but I believe I am
 missing something major because I've also had my setting checked/verified.
 
 The problem is that the site-wide setup does NOT seem to work. Why?
 
 1. I have my local.cf in /etc/mail/spamassassin
 2. I have spamd running, and mail delivery logs show that all e-mails are
    being passed thro SA.
 
 My local.cf contains:
 
 ENABLED=1
 OPTIONS=""-F 0""
 
 #
 rewrite_subject         0
 report_header           1  
 defang_mime             0

 eng.ngware@runji.co.ke
   deliver to enginngware in domain runjiri.co.ke
   director = spamcheck_director, transport = spamcheck
 
 
 However when I check the mail delivered to this mailbox, SA has _not_ added any headers
 to it.
 
 PERTINENT: I also run a Virus Scanner called DRWEB via Exim's system filter and the rules
 that I have applied are:
 
 if not first_delivery or
     $received_protocol is ""drweb-scanned"" or
     $received_protocol is ""spam-scanned""
 then
   finish
 endif
 
 
 Some enlightenment would bail me out, I believe.
 
 Thanks

 Read the article.  I'm afraid I don't understand how the transmission
 prices could have hit $50/tcf.
 
 But I'm also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run
 a pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance.
 We had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago.
 
 So maybe the judge has a point.  We'll see as the appeals work its way
 out.

 It's quite a bit more than natural selection; the times had a
 fascinating article a few months back (possibly posted as bits here)
 that note that one Holstein bull who died in the 70s is paternally
 related to something like 40% of the world's cattle. That's way, way
 more than natural selection, and (given the difficulty and expense of
 isolating specific genes for size, industrial-living-ness, etc.) more
 expansive than raw gene manipulation will be for some time.

383,"Raymond L. Wallace, 83
 Bigfoot Story Teller
 (1919-2002)
 
 Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
 events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
 construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
 home.
 
 It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray Wallaces
 company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
 August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
 found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
 taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
 from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called Bigfoot.  Crew
 took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
 County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
 plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
 revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to todays
 global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
 and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
 Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.
 
 Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
 of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
 offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
 failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
 through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
 Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
 He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
 about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
 guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
 researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
 his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
 Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
 Bigfoot mystery.
 
 In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
 could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
 forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
 adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
 care and respect and would like to train the creature to ride around with
 him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
 came forth with a baby Bigfoot.
 
 Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
 the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
 such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.
 
 Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
 State, on November 30, 2002.

 Do this:

 Well you are right, sorry, I didn't have any better idea yesterday late in
 the evening.
 The fonts are ugly only inside of gnome2 and clean for gnome1 apps, if
 antialiasing is disabled. 
 This is difficult to understand for me.

 I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
 (unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
 a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.
 
 Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
 releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
 some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
 dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
 apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
 as the newest, thus being kept on the system.
 
 As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
 or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
 (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
 probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)

 John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
 [1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
 gold rush. 
 
 Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
 advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
 product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
 consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. 
 
 There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
 rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
 immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
 to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
 And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
 of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

  Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
  
  
  AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
  his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
  (160,000). 
  
  Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
  said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
  young woman - preferably under 30. 
  
  ""I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
  me gets all the money,"" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
  
  ""I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
  fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
  end with a heart attack and then Im gone."" 
  
  Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
  sent in quickly because of his age. ""It could end very soon,"" he said.

 What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
 its considerably
 clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
 common practice of
 putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
 cameras, visiting dignitaries,
 etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
 ""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
 with riot gear and pepper spray.
 
 We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
 strayed from the permit area,
 which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
 ministers held here (the motorcade drove
 by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
 arrested. Not very muddied at all.

 Good. I actually looking at `yes` but I was in

 To remove newlines then handiest is: tr -d '\n'

 Well, here's my semi-coherent rant for the moment.  ;)
 
 I have >3100 spamtraps on my machine (you can multiply that by each domain
 if you really want to).  The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never
 ever existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to
 deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering
 to 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I
 got around to making them spamtraps.
 
 So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)
 If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,
 it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can
 say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if
 the majority of them don't work.
 
 If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but
 then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through
 someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every
 email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address
 because again it's easy to trace you.
 
 So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think
 you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of
 opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't
 relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.
 
 Everyone else doesn't really care.
 
 
 That's my view anyway. :)

 Rendering engines used in todays game titles utilize various techniques for 
 hidden surface removal (HSR), different techniques being suitable for different 
 game genres. For example, action games played in closed-in locations need an 
 engine allowing fast rendering of a few hundred polygons, a high frame rate, 
 and a high level of details to impress players. Conversely, a game that is 
 taking place outdoors requires quite a different approach. This features 
 present one one technique for hidden surface removal usable in 3D engines using 
 tilizing object occlusion.

 If you want to do http, C gets pretty muddy (curl is about the best
 choice I've found) but I grant you that: No language is the be-all and
 end-all.
 
 I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for
 24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of
 code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to
 maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  
 
 As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much as
 I've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've never
 ever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to be
 responsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I am
 so sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.
 
 Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've been
 using C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found
 any decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in
 the task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by no
 means perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party
 libs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really
 hate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.
 
 For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll
 together a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing a
 stream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relational
 databases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open an
 XMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Where
 can I find C libs for those components?  
 
 On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socket
 which can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodically
 refresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,
 presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, and
 again, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langauge
 but Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's not
 ready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in C
 is just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.
 
 When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?
 Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How do
 you evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and
 trying it out?
 
 In a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see the
 social infrastructure for either happening during my professional
 lifetime.

 Those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they're
 interesting.  The tiny spam/ham collections in GBayes are also worthless
 now.  The ""self test"" feature didn't do anything except print its results;
 Tester.py since became doctest'ed and verifies that some basic machinery

 At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3

 This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
 It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail

 to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
 the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
 configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
 files like sendmail.
 
 Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
 are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
 scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
 fine.

409,"My only joke, thanks to a professor at the University of Manitoba, circa 
 1997. Set in the old west.
 
 A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
 surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
 take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
 tribe deals with their victims:
 Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
 grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
 slow death. Time for your first wish.
 
 The cowboy thinks a bit, and says ""I want to talk to my horse."" So the 
 indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
 horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
 beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
 appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.
 
 The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
 yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says ""I want to 
 talk to my horse"". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
 its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
 back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
 and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.
 
 On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
 eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
 and the cowboy again says ""I want to talk to my horse."" The horse is 
 brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
 stares right at him, and says -- ""Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!""

 Dear Investor,
 
 Thank you again for requesting our free special 
 report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
 BUZZING.""
 
 We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
 investors like you deserved better. 
 
 Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
 research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
 codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
 recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
 financial disclosure"" in big business today.
 
 Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
 folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
 stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
 from others when you could count on your own 
 abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 
 
 More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
 site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
 Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so

 This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware 
 Publishing, presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
 approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
 values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
 not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
 more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

 If I create an RPM according to one of the how-to's with having
 Red Hat in mind, how big are my chances that it will also work
 for the SuSE distribution, or others?  (I don't know how many
 base on the RPM system.)
 
 Or what must I pay attention to when creating an RPM that should
 work with the big distributions?
 
 Tschoe,
 Torsten.

 I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
 Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
 popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
 (or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].
 
 I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
 popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
 the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
 problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
 describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:
 
 _Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
 Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._
 
 Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
 these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
 lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
 Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
 browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
 wrong, and they don't listen. 
 
 Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
 Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
 stupid, incompetent buffoons?
 
 ""I told you so."" never felt so good.
 
 Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
 fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.

 Personal lasers come in shapes, sizes, and prices to suit almost 
 any user. A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as 
 $199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a 
 good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive 
 models will suit students or home users who need to print letters 
 or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks. 
 In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity 
 paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for 
 corporate and small-business users. 
 <p>
 Check out a few of our favorites below and find the laser printer
 with the right price and features for you!

 Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
 engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
 Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
 sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
 months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
 lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
 every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
 to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
 design/programming issue.
 
 That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
 re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
 language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
 The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
 detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
 bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
 you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
 a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
 (or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
 Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
 could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
 raw performance scalability.

 A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
 short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
 life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
 from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. 
 
 The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
 card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
 then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
 the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. 
 
 The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
 and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
 her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
 ""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
 happy for her daughter. 
 
 The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
 a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
 whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
 handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
 Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
 and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
 day, seven days a week, both ways."" 
 
 Mom fainted.

     Well, if you have a Windows, SCO, or AIX box, (generally anything BUT Redhat Linux) that'd be the site I'd send you to, to get it installed.  I've been there for the same reason, under SCO.  Maybe you missed something?

 I would question anything being ready for ""production"" being in
 STABLE.
 
 He's kept backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is major plus.
 
 My point about IPFW2 being rolled out into stable was merely an
 illustration of the fact that ipfw is indeed not ipfilter, and that
 there are no license issues there :)

 In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
 particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
 work on client's systems.
 
 My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
 Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.
 
 Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
 They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
 service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
 run C programs.

 If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve,

 You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time

 entirely on the programmer, not the language.

 Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
 in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
 10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
 libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
 At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
 the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

 You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
 some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for

 Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
 time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
 wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
 in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
 that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
 or I can do it now when very few people can.

 It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes

 Not.
 
 Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

433,"I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
 updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?
 
 My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
 get a button that reads:
 	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
 If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
 then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
 	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
 along with a button with the inscription
 	""Query keyserver""
 If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.
 
 If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
 and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
 must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.

 visiting www.rpm.org <http://www.rpm.org>  and the related links they give
 but they all seems to assume that RPM already is installed.
 I have a firewall based on linux-2.2.20 (Smoothwall) for private use.
 I would like to install the RPM package/program but there is no information
 how to do this from scratch.
 Found this site and hopefully some have the knowledge.
 Best regards Manfred Grobosch

 Did you actually attempt to order the DSL? Large chunks of somerville have
 advertised DSL service that can't actually be obtained. Excuses vary, from
 ""no available copper"" to ""full DSLAM"", but the folks I know who've wanted
 DSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an
 honest-to-god T1.

 This is scary.  I'm imagining tracerouting you and seeing links like ""Route

 i took a look into the repository it ""just"" contains gstreamer and his dependecies
 but thats nice for people who use it though :)
 
 thanks,
 che
 
 personally i am capped to 16 kb/s upstream only :\ if i just had like 10 to 20 times of that i would run a repository for sure. i guess alot of people would love to even get daily builds (yes i know i deserve to be eaten for that idea because it would need alot of bandwidth) but well would still be nice :).

 Ie if you are getting a little orange LED when you plug it in then your PSU
 is probably working.

 Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
 spamassassin/razor interaction.
 
 Now for a razor question:
 
 I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
 on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
 easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
 up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
 directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.
 
 Thanks,
 Dave

            Summary: IMG tag based rules
            Product: Spamassassin
            Version: unspecified
           Platform: Other
         OS/Version: other
             Status: NEW
           Severity: enhancement
           Priority: P2
          Component: Eval Tests
         AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
         ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
 
 
 Inspired by complaints about all-image or mostly-image spam that's
 getting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
 of IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the
 images in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the
 total number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that
 looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
 (T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).
 
 ===============
 
 The total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of
 HTML::html_tests(), if an IMG tag has both the width and height
 properties, then multiply them together and add the result to the
 running total.

 Spam % of all rules with S/O > 0.90: 31.25%
 
 =========================
 
 I figured that spam that is made up of only images is going to only
 have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,
 and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain
 text (non-whitespace) between them.  So I defined consecutive IMG tags
 to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of
 consecutive IMGs within a message.
 
 This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus
 there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.

 What are you trying to sell???? What is the Value???
 
 Example...Does Pratchett sell paper bound by glue or does he sell stories?
 
 
 
 Question...When I buy a book have I purchased the story? When I sell the
 book does any of that revenue go to mr Pratchett?
 
 What if I read the book and  give it to someone, who then reads it
 and gives it  to someone who then reads it and gives it to
 someones....(bookcrossing.com though with  more succesfull passings). Does
 each reader send Mr Pratchett money?
 
 Have Used Bookstores, Recorstores etc destroyed the system of book/record
 economy?
 
 AS to the resident sourpuss, in germany bitter may be better but here its
 just plain stinkin thinkin.

 Yeah, I was thinking of the G4 keyboard when I wrote this. Otherwise lousy
 feel and key placement, though. (That's why I'm holding on to my IBM Model
 M Space Saver. Once I get an PS2 to USB converter, I expect it will
 outlive several generations of computer hardware).
 
 Very good for sticking in USB fobs into, though. CRTs/LCD panels are even 
 better for that, though.

 I think laptops are largely useless because of the battery and the 
 keyboard issue.

 BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A JET?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in
 the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's
 sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.
 
 The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the
 bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be
 traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened
 except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White
 House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the
 first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the 
 major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2
 billion in the past year.)
 
 Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in
 pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce
 competition from discounters, a too-small area of service
 concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with
 United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business.
 Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years
 ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by
 United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators
 that it was too small to survive on 
 its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.
 
 Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those
 likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has
 vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their
 jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of
 millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially
 plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a
 bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter
 who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one
 creditor was named in any account we could find. Yet before we
 soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word
 from the folks getting stiffed.)
 
 Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which
 observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability""
 thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that
 anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is
 plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas 
 Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and
 pocketed 11 times its investment.
 
 Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways
 customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York
 Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor
 frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use
 U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner,
 United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, 
 there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next
 major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel

 REMEMBER GLOBAL CROSSING?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories
 fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this
 summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global
 Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to 
 recall the fuss over chads.
 
 The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday
 a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be 
 holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because 
 the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention,
 especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the
 Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to
 say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed 
 for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- and
 that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back
 in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three
 times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian
 conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies
 Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. 
 
 Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the
 deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the 
 regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two 
 investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and
 bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the
 slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The
 company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the
 crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
 the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for 
 the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times
 quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend 
 its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. 
 But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is
 simply buying low so it can sell higher. 
 
 Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is
 approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary
 Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock,
 as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom
 bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah
 Asbrand

 					<P>Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.</P><P>
 The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.)</P><P>
 Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was
 too small to survive on <br>
 its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.</P><P>
 Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one creditor was
 named in any account we could find. Yet before we soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed.)</P><P>
 Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability"" thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and pocketed 11 times its investment.</P><P>
 Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner, United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel</P><P>

 					<P>Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads.</P><P>
 The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention, especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million --
 and that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. </P><P>
 Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
 the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher. </P><P>
 Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock, as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah Asbrand</P><P>

 When you boot from the WNT/W2k/whatever install CD, it offers you the
 choice of installing a new system, or repairing an existing

 Hi there,
 
 I recently delved into how the linux system clock and the hardware clock
 interact with each other when I set up ntp on my system while connected
 to the net. However, I didn't realise that Windows altered the hw clock
 as there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read. 
 I still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing
 with the clock, I'd be interested to know in what way it is and how it
 couild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I
 set the system up but I still don't like to have these gaps in my
 knowledge.
 
 Regards,
 Anthony Geoghegan

 Writing an IMAP server is a non-trivial task.  The specification is huge
 and clients do all kinds of weird stuff.  POP is very easy in
 comparison.  Perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or
 save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives.
 
 Alternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client
 that could be used to review additions to the training set.  Each day a
 few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates.
 Someone would periodically startup the client, review the candidates,
 reclassify or remove any messages they don't like and add them to the
 training set.

451,"I am somewhat puzzled by a phone call I (or rather the CIO at the ISP for
 whom I work) received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark.
 The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our
 mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain
 information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be
 required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was
 wondering if anyone else has received such a call?
 
 I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users
 with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or
 whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by
 the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and
 the likes).

453,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at
 part of the equation.
 
 America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is
 a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There
 is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the
 right time, to go that high.
 
 Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is
 involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.
 Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.
 Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.
 
 Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the
 rest of us who tend to sort.
 
 There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the
 first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree
 at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits
 of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.
 
 And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity
 of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most
 people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better
 if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the
 Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'
 is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.
 
 Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far
 more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.
 Superior performance, often not.

 you checked it out and before you sent this mail...I hoped I was fast enough

 <h3>USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST</h3>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are two <code>Collections</code> classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an <code>ArrayList</code> of Strings, or a <code>LinkedList</code> of Integers. This tip compares the performance of <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code>, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The first key point is that an <code>ArrayList</code> is backed by a primitive <code>Object</code> array. Because of that, an <code>ArrayList</code> is much faster than a <code>LinkedList</code> for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the <code>get</code> method. Note that the <code>get</code> method is implemented for <code>LinkedLists</code>, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a <code>LinkedList</code>, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo1 {
         static final int N = 10000;
 
         static List values;
 
         // make List of increasing Integer values
 
         static {
            Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];
 
            Random rn = new Random();
 
            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                vals[i] = new Integer(currval);
                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
            }
 
            values = Arrays.asList(vals);
         }
         
         // iterate across a list and look up every
         // value in the list using binary search
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
 
                // look up a value in the list 
                // using binary search
 
                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                    lst, values.get(i));
 
                // sanity check for result 
                // of binary search
 
                if (indx != i) {
                    System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                }
            }
 
            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }
 
        public static void main(String args[]) {
 
            // do lookups in an ArrayList 
 
            System.out.println(&quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                timeList(new ArrayList(values)));
 
            // do lookups in a LinkedList
 
            System.out.println(
                &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                timeList(new LinkedList(values)));
        }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ListDemo1</code> program sets up a <code>List</code> of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Then <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> is used to search for each value in the 
 list.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 31
 
     time for LinkedList = 4640
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> is about 150 times faster than <code>LinkedList</code>. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for <code>ArrayList</code> as compared to that for <code>LinkedList</code>. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, <code>LinkedList</code> is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and <code>LinkedList</code> does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a <code>LinkedList</code> is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an <code>ArrayList</code> has a fixed time.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You can use the <code>RandomAccess</code> marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     void f(List lst) {
         if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {
             // supports fast random access
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> implements the <code>RandomAccess</code> interface, and <code>LinkedList</code>. does not. Note that <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> does take advantage of the <code>RandomAccess</code> property, to optimize searches.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Do these results prove that <code>ArrayList</code> is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where <code>LinkedList</code> does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for <code>LinkedList</code>. An example is reversing a <code>LinkedList</code> using <code>Collections.reverse</code>. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, <code>LinkedList</code> is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following &quot;worst case&quot; scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo2 {
         static final int N = 50000;
 
         // time how long it takes to add 
         // N objects to a list
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             Object obj = new Object();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 lst.add(0, obj);
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         public static void main(String args[]) {
 
             // do timing for ArrayList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new ArrayList()));
 
             // do timing for LinkedList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new LinkedList()));
         }
     } 
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, the result should look something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 4859
 
     time for LinkedList = 125
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When an element is added to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code>, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code> has a cost that's proportional to the list size.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The <code>LinkedList</code> class has a private internal class defined like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static class Entry {
         Object element;
         Entry next;
         Entry previous;
     } 
 </pre>
 
 
 <p>
 Each <code>Entry</code> object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the <code>LinkedList</code> -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A <code>LinkedList</code> of 1000 elements will have 1000 <code>Entry</code> objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a <code>LinkedList</code> structure, given all these <code>Entry</code> objects.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 An <code>ArrayList</code> has a backing <code>Object</code> array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an <code>ArrayList</code> with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way <code>ArrayList</code> works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If you know how many elements will be in an <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the <code>trimToSize</code> method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this discussion has assumed that either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code> is &quot;right&quot; for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You could store the pairs in an N x 2 <code>Object</code> array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of <code>ArrayLists</code>, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a <code>HashMap</code>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Which is faster, a binary search on an <code>ArrayList</code>, or a <code>HashMap</code>? Here's a final example that compares these two:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo3 {
         static final int N = 500000;
 
         // Lists of keys and values
 
         static List keys;
         static List values;
 
         // fill the keys list with ascending order key 
         // values and fill the values list with
         // corresponding values (-key)
 
         static {
             Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N];
             Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N];
 
             Random rn = new Random();
 
             for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval);
                 valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval);
                 currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
             }
 
             keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec);
             values = Arrays.asList(valuevec);
         }
 
         // fill a Map with key/value pairs
 
         static Map map = new HashMap();
 
         static {
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i));
             }
         }
 
         // do binary search lookup of all keys
 
         static long timeList() {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                     keys, keys.get(i));
 
                 // sanity check of returned value 
                 // from binary search
 
                 if (indx != i) {
                     System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                 }
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         // do Map lookup of all keys
 
         static long timeMap() {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 Integer value = (Integer)map.get(
                                           keys.get(i));
 
                 // sanity check of value returned 
                 // from map lookup
 
                 if (value != values.get(i)) {
                     System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                 }
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         public static void main(String args[]) {
 
             // do timing for List implementation
 
             System.out.println(""List time = "" + 
                                            timeList());
 
             // do timing for Map implementation
 
             System.out.println(&quot;Map time = &quot; + 
                                             timeMap());
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The program sets up <code>Lists</code> of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run the <code>ListDemo3</code> program, you should get a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     ArrayList time = 1000
 
     HashMap time = 281
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the <code>ArrayList</code> will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:
 </p>
 
 <ul>
   <li>Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList.</code> For <code>ArrayList</code>, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For <code>LinkedList</code>, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal <code>Entry</code> object.</li>
 
   <li>Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an <code>ArrayList</code> implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost.</li>
 
   <li>A <code>LinkedList</code> does not support efficient random access</li>
 
   <li>An <code>ArrayList</code> has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A <code>LinkedList</code> has significant space overhead per element.</li>
 
   <li>Sometimes a <code>Map</code> structure is a better choice than a <code>List</code>.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS</h3>
 
 <p>
 Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates &quot;outliers,&quot; that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo1 {
     
         // filter input array and throw away values 
         // that are less than minval or greater than 
         // maxval
     
         static int[] filterData(
                 int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {
     
             // check parameters for errors 
     
             if (indata == null) {
                 throw new NullPointerException(
                                      &quot;indata is null&quot;);
             }
             if (maxval &lt; minval) {
                 throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                 &quot;maxval &lt; minval&quot;);
             }
     
             // count number of valid values 
             // in input array
     
             int validcnt = 0;
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                          &lt;= maxval) {
                     validcnt++;
                 }
             }
     
             // if no valid values, return null
     
             if (validcnt == 0) {
                 return null;
             }
     
             // copy valid values to new array 
             // and return it
     
             int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
             for (int i = 0, j = 0; 
                               i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                            &lt;= maxval) {
                     outdata[j++] = indata[i];
                 }
             }
             return outdata;
         }
     
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up test array of integers
     
             int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};
     
             // filter out values not in the range 1-10
     
             int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata1.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata1[i]);
             }
     
             // filter out values not 
             // in the range 100-200
     
             int outdata2[] = filterData(
                                      indata, 100, 200);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata2.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata2[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>filterData</code> method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     1
     3
     8
     Exception in thread &quot;main&quot;
     java.lang.NullPointerException
         at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of <code>filterData</code> returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     /*
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return null;
     }
     */
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 For the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return outdata;
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Note that usage such as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[]{};
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = 
                                             new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo2 {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up ArrayList and add strings to it
     
             List stringlist = new ArrayList();
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 1&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 2&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 3&quot;);
     
             // convert to String array
     
             String out[] = (
                           String[])stringlist.toArray(
             new String[0]);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; out.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(out[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     string 1
     string 2
     string 3
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program sets up an <code>ArrayList</code>, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls <code>toArray</code> to get a <code>String</code> array of the three elements in the <code>ArrayList</code>. In this example, the argument to <code>toArray</code> is &quot;new String[0]&quot;. This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a <code>String</code> array that's big enough to hold the elements of the <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify it as the argument to <code>toArray</code>. The method will use the <code>String</code> array.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But if your array is not big enough, then the <code>toArray</code> method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. <code>ArrayList</code> stores its element references in an <code>Object</code> array. The <code>toArray</code> method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (<code>java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance</code>) to create an array of the appropriate type.

 All it takes is an overtorqued nut (e.g. at the water intake entrance)
 to stress the porcelain, and you've got a time bomb waiting to go off.
 Of course, if you're lucky, you'll overtorque it enough that the tank
 will break right away, while you still have the water intake shut off.

 Using Razor2 via SpamAssasin.
 
 System is Solaris 2.7, with qmail. Spamassassin run via user's procmail.
 All users who use SA have run razor-register.
 
 Razor2 is failing, and I can't find anything in the limited docs or on 
 google on it,
 and I'm hoping someone can help.
 
 The error (which doesn't prevent SA from working) is:

 Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
 Pipeline[1] 
 
 Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
 oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
 him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
 begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
 to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
 9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. 
 
 Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
 Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
 for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
 rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
 because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. 
 
 Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
 carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
 carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
 gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
 after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
 opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
 Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. 
 
 ""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
 right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
 justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
 friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
 influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
 advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
 Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
 cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""

 As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file 
 first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This 
 happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.
 That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to 
 have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what 
 messages are in this sequence?"".  One option would have been to add another 
 call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time 
 technique would be less error-prone.
 
 I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow 
 a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the 
 current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences 
 for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday.
 
 And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.
 
 Chris

 I'm skeptical.  
 
 One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
 rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
 is more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
 history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
 Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
 Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
 know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
 People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
 substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
 facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
 that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
 Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
 in popular culture.
 
 I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
 you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
 have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
 population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.

485,"Does anyone know what happened to vCard support in Netscape 7.0/Mozilla 
 1.1?
  (Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I 
 presume?)
 
 Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can't 
 find vCard or a reference to it anywhere.  I like the Netscape/Mozilla 
 email client.  I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only 
 (my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues.
 
 Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are 
 becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard?
 Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between 
 the two?
 
 I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along 
 with more PKI oriented focus.  Any wisdom would be appreciated.  In 
 particular, I'm going to start integrating smart cards into my linux and 
 Win32 systems and integrating them with Netscape Messenger/Mozilla and 
 Outlook.
 
 Thanks

 An investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich 
 were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.
 
 Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
 the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
 Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.
 
 Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
 woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
 for the filling to be tested.
 
 The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
 Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
 horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.
 
 So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
 contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.
 
 Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
 is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.
 
 ""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
 why the bags contain such unusual contents.""

 The two problems I see with filtering that early are:
 
     1. Everyone receiving email via that server will contribute ham to the
        stew, making the Bayesian classification less effective.
 
     2. Given that there will be some false positives, you absolutely have to
        put the mail somewhere.  You can't simply delete it.  (I also don't
        like the TMDA-ish business of replying with a msg that says, ""here's
        what you do to really get your message to me.""  That puts an extra
        burden on my correspondents.)  As an individual, I would prefer you
        put spammish messages somewhere where I can review them, not an
        anonymous sysadmin who I might not trust with my personal email
        (nothing against you Greg ;-).
 
 I personally prefer to manage this stuff at the user agent level.  Bandwidth
 is a heck of a lot cheaper than my time.

 The tooth fairy?
 
 There were never millions of natives in Florida (until recently :).
 
 Cortez never went to Florida, AFAIK.  Ponce de Leon discovered it.
 The Indian peoples he found there stuck around until a bunch of them
 moved to Cuba with the Spanish when a bunch of Seminole Indians
 invaded from the North with the English, in the seventeenth century.
 The remainder merged in with the new population, or died, or whatever,
 and their culture disappeared.

     I hate to ask...I've heard it mentioned several times here, but I couldn't find a digest, and the hits I found on Google turned up missing pages.  :(
 
     I thought I was reporting spams all this time...the last month or so...but I wasn't.  I had a pathing problem going on, and a log-pathing problem, too, but hadn't noticed it yet.  Now, the system seems to be working, other than this message in the logs:
 
     nextserver: Could not get valid info from Discovery Servers
 
     What's the fix for this again?  Is it a server outtage, or something else?
 
     I'm using the 2.03 sdk, and the new 2.14 agent...

 I'm a bit confused about this boycott thing.  How is what China is
 doing any different than having Scientology and who ever else
 state-side who takes the whim evoking the DMCA to close down foreign
 sites they deem inappropriate?  At least the Chinese make it voluntary
 and ask politely, rather than just sending legal musclemen first off.

  Buying any new machine is going to cause problems with a six month old
 set of drivers. Same happens in windows - you have to go get your drivers.
 
  Yes, dell use the most recent stuff they can, to save money. That's not a
 bad thing. Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of
 the box.

 Weighing in at 9.6 pounds, the new <b>Toshiba Satellite 1955-S801</b> notebook 
 has a 2.2GHz Pentium 4 desktop processor and a huge 16-inch display. The 
 <b>desktop-replacement notebook</b> category also includes the Satellite 1905 
 that Toshiba introduced last month, as well as products from Hewlett-Packard. 
 Gateway and Dell may be looking at the concept too.  The Satellite 1955 will 
 cost $2,499 and sports a few features not found in other desktop-replacement 
 notebooks, including a detachable wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.

 <font size=""+1""><b>Tech gets set for China breakthrough</b></a></font><br>
 
 
 
 It's one of the few words that can perk up a high-technology executive these 
 days: China. Companies have attempted to tap the country's <b>enormous potential</b> 
 for years, but it has become a far more attractive target recently as 
 the rest of the world remains mired in <b>economic problems</b>. Now, the People's 
 Republic of China has become one of the leading strategic opportunities for 
 Intel, Nokia, Hewlett-Packard and virtually every other multinational.

 Some of you want one, many of you say you need one. But what will be the primary role 
 of TabletPC: Vertical applications? A notebook/desktop replacement? Home use? 
 Or will it meet the same fate as previous tablet attempts?

 I think it was George Carlin who said something to the effect that young
 men in general are boring, but, around fifty, men either have everything
 they ever wanted, or have almost nothing of what they wanted; either of
 which makes them behave quite interestingly.

499,"Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
 all. Thanks for your suggestions.
 
 Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
 fan.
 
 I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg133.86)
 but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
 It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3"" drive bays so I should be ok for
 future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
 on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
 off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
 screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
 off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
 is big and has loads of room inside.
 Oh... and it looks very cool :-)
 
 However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says
 
 * Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
 * ATX Power supply sold separately
 
 In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
 ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
 Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
 USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
 that show) but I missed that :-)
 
 I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
 (thanks Mike)
 
 So now I can code-in-peace...

 For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or
 java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.
 
 I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
 dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
 written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important
 IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an
 option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.
 
 Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of ""oops,
 there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
 around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
 rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best"".
 
 This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source
 knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)

 Internet can level the political playing field
 By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro
 
 NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
 of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
 malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
 stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
 public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
 personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
 ask for our votes.
 
 Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
 has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.
 
 In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
 Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
 addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
 each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.
 
 That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
 expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
 spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.
 
 Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
 been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
 would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
 through any of those channels.
 
 The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
 was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
 entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
 refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
 ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.
 
 His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
 because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
 may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
 in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
 mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.
 
 No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
 highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
 it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
 unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.
 
 The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
 that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
 believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
 TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
 simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
 future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
 taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.
 
 When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
 Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
 to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
 accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.
 
 Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
 Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
 ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
 groups.
 
 But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
 an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
 opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
 the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
 advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
 Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
 they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

 please email me your key info (name, key ID, type, size,
 fingerprint), and I will add you to the list.
 
 If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one.
 
 Want to find out more about PGP?
 <http://www.uk.pgp.net/pgpnet/pgp-faq/>
 
 You can get the software from:
 
 PGPfreeware <http://www.pgpi.org/products/pgp/versions/freeware/>
 GnuPG (GPG) <http://www.pgpi.org/download/gnupg/>
 
 
 Bring the following:
 
    *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)
    *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size
 
 I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then
 individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys.
 
 It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from
 their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key
 information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID
 for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then
 person B can check off that person on their list.
 
 The reverse is then done for person B.
 
 After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked
 names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a
 keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the
 checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using
 your private key.
 
 Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a
 copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

 Well, all the transhumanists should be very interested in this one:<br>
 &lt;<a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992677"" eudora=""autourl"">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992677</a>&gt;<br><br>
 <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>Cross-species testes transplant
 successful </blockquote><br>
 <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>19:00 14 August 02 NewScientist.com
 news service <br>
 Testis tissue from goats and pigs has been grafted onto the backs of mice
 and shown to produce normal sperm, capable of fertilising eggs. <br>
 It is the first time testis tissue from such distant species has produced
 mature sperm when grafted in mice. &quot;It might work for primates or
 even humans,&quot; claims Ina Dobrinski of the University of
 Pennsylvania, one of the co-authors of the study. <br>
 If so, the technique could be used to preserve the reproductive potential
 of male cancer patients about to undergo therapies that would destroy
 their ability to make sperm.<br>
 Men often freeze sperm samples before receiving chemotherapy, but young
 boys cannot do this because they do not produce mature sperm. If it works
 in humans, the technique would allow testis tissue grafted from boys to
 mature and produce sperm.<br><br>
 Infectious particles <br>
 The mouse grafting technique also has an advantage over another option
 for preserving fertility - testicular transplants. These involve
 re-implanting preserved germ cells into the testes after cancer
 remission. <br>
 But the grafting approach &quot;would eliminate any possibility of
 passing cancer cells back to the patient,&quot; says reproductive
 biologist Michael Griswold from Washington State University.<br>
 However, it is possible that the grafting procedure could introduce
 mouse-derived infectious particles into human embryos, making some
 scientists wary of the idea. &quot;I would very much hesitate to say that
 it's something we should be doing,&quot; says reproductive biologist
 Roger Gosden of the East Virginia Medical School.<br><br>
 Castrated mice <br>
 In the study, Dobrinski and colleagues placed small pieces of testis
 tissue from newborn goats or pigs just under the skin on the backs of
 castrated mice. Two to four weeks later, they found that more than half
 of the 477 grafts had survived and were producing normal-looking goat or
 pig sperm.<br>
 When they injected the graft-derived sperm directly into eggs they saw
 clear signs of fertilisation, indicating that the sperm function
 normally. The researchers also found that the procedure worked just as
 well with testis tissue that had been refrigerated for two days or frozen
 for several weeks.<br>
 Gosden has tried transplanting human testes tissue into mice, but was not
 successful. However, Dobrinski believes the technique could soon be used
 to preserve the germ lines of endangered species, including rare animals
 that usually die in captivity before reaching sexual maturity. &quot;We
 think that's a very real application,&quot; she says.<br>
 She adds that mice with human testis tissue grafts would also be useful
 to scientists who want to test the effects of toxic substances and new
 contraceptives on human sperm production. <br>

 It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
 visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
 the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
 the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
 officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
 mail.  
 
 Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.
 
 But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
 but so what.

 Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
 But that obscures the different modes of
 promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
 money or power or companionship and the person
 who uses money and power and companionship to
 get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
 of the word. But their motives and behavior are
 quite different.
 
 Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
 article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
 are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
 .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
 cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
 the best strategy for female langurs, because
 ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
 extra-group males as possible, female langurs
 ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
 by the male who is likely next to rule the
 roost.
 
 Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
 picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
 promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
 is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
 better picture of that. ;-)

519,"Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
 all. Thanks for your suggestions.
 
 Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
 fan.
 
 I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg133.86)
 but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
 It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3"" drive bays so I should be ok for
 future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
 on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
 off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
 screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
 off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
 is big and has loads of room inside.
 Oh... and it looks very cool :-)
 
 However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says
 
 * Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
 * ATX Power supply sold separately
 
 In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
 ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
 Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
 USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
 that show) but I missed that :-)
 
 I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
 (thanks Mike)
 
 So now I can code-in-peace...

 Which was my point. Gurls don't do hyperpromiscuity as a life style. It's
 interesting that you're launching into a diatribe, and threaten using
 instant argument (just add hominem) instead of assuming I might be not

524,"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
 choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
 It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
 is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
 somewhat simpler to setup. 
 
 The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
 run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
 IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.
 
 So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
 significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
 If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
 on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
 sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
 in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

 I'm facing another problem right now. It looks like libsigc++ is no longer

 Real viruses are filtered before they reach any mailbox for delivery.
 
 Tose two addresses could be accessible only for internal mail.
 
 And as a user is using this mechanism to build his own database of
 spam/non-spam, that's his problem is he sumbit something wrong.
 
 BTW, same forgery or wrong submission problems would exist if each

 Hi Tim,
 It isn't a ""version"" of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob.
 It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit's atop Mach and
 uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn't really a BSD.
 
 (Here's a neat trick, touch ""Makefile"" and ""makefile"", notice the lack of
 error message but the absence of ""makefile"", and don't bother formatting for
 UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,
 implemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get's tweaked every
 now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there
 somewhere down the road. )
 
 Then there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
 of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
 would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.
 
 All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
 environment.
 
 As for your initial question,

 Mark.

  This is a pain. 
 
  The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
 original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:
 
  rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*
 
  RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
 and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
 installed is beyond me.

536,"Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. 
 
 However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
 * cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
 * make oldconfig
 * make dep
 The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?
 
 Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory
 
 The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?
 
 It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric

 DVDSynth is an open source project that allows you to splice in your own 
 footage, alternate audio, subtitles, etc, to any DVD. This means that you can 
 insert your own non-sucky subtitles, make and circulate edit-lists that make 
 highlight reels for your favorite movies, etc, etc. It all amounts to a sweet 
 tool for making the audience into the _former audience_, participants in 
 entertainment. Of course, it's also illegal under the DMCA, since the tool also 
 necessarily circumvents the copy-prevention in pre-recorded DVDs to accomplish 
 its ends. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via NTK[3]_)

 I wouldn't make that assumption.  I'd assume that rewrite_subject was on, 
 and report_header was off, because that's the default configuration, and 
 not everyone knows to go look in the user_prefs file to make those 
 changes.

 Yeah, but these would be different cases relating to copyright infringements,
 not about ISP's blocking mail or not.

 Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in
 the fat from your typical liposuction job to make a decent diamond.

 Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
 might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
 only reads the first n lines.

 at the Tcl prompt in the Log window.  I suspect that the sequence
 parser, which understands things like 5-22 to mean messages 5 through 22
 is confused when asked to add/remove message ""-"" from a sequence.
 
 If we are allowed to assume 8.2 or higher, which we can't really, then
 we could add
 
 if {![string is integer $select(sel)]} {
    # bail out of message select mode
 }
 to the SelectTypein procedure.
 
 We can probably survive with
 
 if {![regexp {^[0-9]+$} $select(sel)]} {

 I'm using ""Python 2.3a0 (#1, Sep  9 2002, 22:56:24)"".
 
 I've fixed it with the following patch to Tim's tokenizer, but I have to
 admit that I'm baffled as to why it works.  Maybe there's some subtle
 interaction between generators and lists that I can't understand.  Or
 something.  Being as I'm baffled, I don't imagine any theory I come up
 with will be anywhere close to reality.
 
 In any case, be advised that (at least for me) hammie will eat
 multipart/alternative messages until this patch is applied.  The patch
 seems rather bogus though, so I'm not checking it in, in the hope that
 there's a better fix I just wasn't capable of discovering :)

 The primary desert warfare facilities and schools ARE in the Southwest,
 most notably Fort Irwin deep in the Mojave/Anza Borrego (the
 headquarters and core training facilities for all things desert warfare
 related), and have been for a long time. There are two reasons that
 immediately come to mind as to why they do not use the Fort Irwin,
 Edwards AFB, and other expanses of desert that they have traditionally
 used for desert warfare training and exercises.  
 
 The first is logistical: Virtually all the mechanized infantry units are
 located east of the Rockies, and it must be very expensive to move
 entire heavy combat divisions a couple thousand miles every time they
 want to run training exercises.  This is particularly true since so much
 of our military is made up of reserve components these days, meaning
 that you can't move the soldiers to where the training facilities are.
 
 The second is environmental lawsuits and pending judicial action and
 injunctions. The desert training facilities in the Southwest deserts
 have been aggressively assaulted by environmental organizations who are
 making the case that heavy mechanized units zipping back and forth
 across the deep desert endanger the desert tortoise and a bunch of other
 theoretically endangered species that are concentrated in the southwest
 deserts. The ability of the military to use the desert facilities has
 been significantly impeded these days while all the lawsuits and whatnot
 with the various environmental groups are being sorted out.

 Using the score-ranges stuff and my aggressive anti-FP evaluation code,
 BTW, yielded an average FP of 5.7 points, with 0.67% FPs and 96.57%
 overall accuracy -- but I notice you went back to the other method.
 Just pointing this out ;)

   <b>Oracle challenges Microsoft anew</b></a></font><br>
 
 Oracle is taking on Microsoft's Exchange with a <b>Collaboration Suite</b> that includes e-mail, calendar and messaging software. Oracle has pitched its products as Microsoft replacements before -- with spectacularly little success. (At Comdex last November, the database giant offered its 9i and app-server software as a more secure <b>alternative to Exchange</b>.) What's different this time? Oracle is selling a separate collaboration product that, says CEO <b>Larry Ellison</b>, is cheaper than rival offerings. Plus: Companies facing a deadline to join Redmond's new <b>licensing program</b> may be more open to non-Micrososft alternatives.

     ZDNET DELIVERS Price-Feature Analysis	Vol 1, No. 2
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 This week, we present a special shopper report featuring
 four cool products. We have reviewed these products,
 compared each to five products with similar features,
 and analyzed the range of prices for each category. What
 you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the ""Price-Feature
 Ratio Analysis."" Featured products can fall in to three
 stages of Price-Feature ratios:
 
 Stage 1: High Price-Feature Ratio - Technophiles will rush
 to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices
 for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one.
 
 Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability
 in prices among products with similar features. It pays to
 comparison shop for the best price.
 
 Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products
 with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much
 from merchant to merchant. Use our merchant ratings to
 find the right one for you.
 
 We have rated each of the products featured in this supplement
 to aid your shopping experience.

 KDS Rad-5 15-inch LCD
 
 The Lowdown: Without our even hitting the power button, the
 stylish KDS Radius Rad-5 stands out from the pack with its
 silver casing and blue highlights. Turn on this basic,
 analog-only LCD and you'll see an equally impressive image
 at its native resolution of 1,024x768.

560,"The case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is
 often far less than the value to the victim.  Stealing my $1,000 sterio
 and then fencing it for $50 does not result in 'no loss' the the economy
 overall.  For the same reason that voluntary transactions increase
 social value, involuntary ones decrease it.  If the sterio was worth as
 much to the theif as it was to me he'd buy it ...
 
 On the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in
 precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but
 the owner's availability to make a contract was problematic.  Breaking
 into your isolated cabin because I'm starving, for example, is
 permissible if I later offer restitution for the damage I caused and the
 food I ate.

 As long as you're not using razor2, that is, right?

 It's still doing it.  I reported a message as spam 10 minutes ago and
 the check keeps coming back false.  What's funny is that message that
 I'm testing with it the sample-spam.txt message from SpamAssassin and I
 know it's been reported before.

 Hi,
 
 We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
 two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
 the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
 normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
 specially with regards to false-positives.
 
 cheers,
 vipul.

 Port San Luis, California
 September 05, 2002
 
 A WHALE which suddenly breached and crashed into the bow of a
 fishing boat killed a restaurant owner on board.
 
 Jerry Tibbs, 51, of Bakersfield, California, was aboard his boat,
 The BBQ, when the whale hit and tossed him into the sea five miles
 off Port San Luis.
 
 Three other fishermen stayed aboard the damaged boat, which was
 towed to shore by the US Coast Guard.
 
 Tibbs and his three friends were just ending a day fishing for
 albacore when the accident occurred, authorities said.
 
 Tibbs' body was found after a search lasting more than 18 hours
 Coast Guard officials said it was the first time they could recall
 an accident caused by a whale hitting a boat.

 [IMG: http://www.konaweb.com/stick/left.jpg] I often carry my ukulele with me 
 on planes. The case is so little it can fit in my suit case. I missed a great 
 photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
 someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
 shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
 should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's 
 a stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still 
 need to carry around an amp, though. Link[1] Discuss[2] _(Thanks, Prentiss[3]!)

   Gaim Changelog
     http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog
 
 Gaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
 protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
 that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
 hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
 untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
 permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
 machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
 user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
 vulnerable.
 
 The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
 command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
 need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
 browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
 'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
 the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
 in the buddy list window.
 
 Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also
 obtain this update from the Ximian FTP site.

 The bowl doesn't hold that much water. I

 it up. Even the tank only holds a gallon,

 Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
 composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
 get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
 ""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...
 
 [Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
 like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
 you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
 *those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
 around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
 transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
 government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
 innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
 summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
 there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]
 
 
 The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
 ""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
 best school possible.
 
 Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
 for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
 ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
 years for proof.
 
 Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
 World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
 Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
 goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
 afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
 couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
 last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
 and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.
 
 
 The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
 degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
 learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
 basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
 death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
 who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
 smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.
 
 BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
 rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
 beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
 were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
 Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
 much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
 this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
 educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
 facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
 There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
 economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
 ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
 intelligence and effort.
 
 [I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
 competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
 apparently.]
 
 
 
 BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
 *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
 all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
 there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
 most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
 *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
 all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
 not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.
 
 That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
 People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
 stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
 apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
 know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
 in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
 extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
 doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
 politician as Santa Claus come election time...
 
 
 In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
 theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
 redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
 that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.
 
 To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
 wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

 It's hard to say whether you need better ham or better spam, but I suspect
 better spam <wink>.  18 of the 30 most powerful discriminators here were
 HTML-related spam indicators; the top 10 overall were:

         'python' 428 0.01
         'content-type:text/html' 454 0.99
 
 The HTML tags come from non-multipart/alternative HTML messages, from which
 HTML tags aren't stripped, and there are lots of these in my spam sets.
 
 That doesn't account for it, though.  If I strip HTML tags out of those too,
 the rates are only a little worse:

 This is called ""pseudo-packages"" or ""meta-packages"" and Debian has been
 using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty
 packages.
 
 Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally
 although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like
 them. For me it's more of an ugly ""hack"" than anything else, and I'd
 approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire
 categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages.
 
 Also, you can trivially do ""apt-get install <metapackage>"", but removing
 all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a
 trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.

 Broadband's killer application  the one activity that dwarfs all others 
 is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according
 to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
 millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer
 games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming
 uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.
 
 ""Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,"" said Kim Hyun
 Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction
 Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with
 Internet game addiction. ""Young people are losing the ability to relate to
 others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to
 violence, even when they are not playing.

 Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all 
 you 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html"">Dreamweaver users</a> out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
 with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
 of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
 easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
 until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
 I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
 so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html"">check 'em out too</a>.

 As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
 switched cell phones to the 
 <a href=""http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htm"">Kyocera QCP6035</a>. 
 The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
 functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
 you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
 cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
 already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
 driving directions. 
 <p>
 Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
 more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
 I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
 be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
 in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.

 As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
 this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
 mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
 e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
 the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
 confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
 to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
 following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
 interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
 with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
 Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
 mySQL are useful in getting this installed.

 Think of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
 OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
 adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
 telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
 effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
 making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
 even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
 jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
 to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
 adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
 by not having this software.

 Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
 happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
 their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
 you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
 sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
 real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
 limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
 an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
 specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
 presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
 be able to make every site you design more user friendly.

 I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
 a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
 itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
 desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
 documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
 their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
 management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
 look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
 detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
 modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
 discussion forum for trading ideas.

 Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
 against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/
 
 What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
 Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
 alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
 dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
 --with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
 alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
 /tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".
 
 Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
 drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
 kernel.
 
 I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
 what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
 kernel recompiled with ACPI.

 Postfix provides a binary called /usr/sbin/sendmail that does the right
 thing. Which, presumably involves sticking your outgoing going message
 in the right queue. Then you need your postfix SMTP client to
 authenticate with your postfix SMTP server. Are you using SASL? If so,
 I remember seeing documentation on how to configure the postfix SMTP
 client to authenticate.

 Try the following newsgroups - 
 Beginners:
 news:comp.lang.learn.c-c++
 
 More advanced: 
 news:comp.lang.c
 news:comp.lang.c++
 news:comp.lang.c.moderated
 
 Also, you should keep a bookmark pointing at the comp.lang.c FAQ at 
 http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html
 
 For tutorials, the guy who maintains the clc FAQ (Steve Summit)
 has a tutorial - http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/top.html
 Also you could have a look at the excercises he poses - all
 linked from http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/cclass.html
 
 For C++, I would guess that the comp.lang.c++ FAQ is a good place
 to start - they're likely to have links to suggested reading
 material.
 
 If you're going to do any amount of C programming, you should
 think about getting K&R2 (The C programming language, 2nd
 edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie), for C++ the equivalent book
 is Stroustrup. Although the C++ book is a lot bigger :)
 
 Hope this helps,
 Dave.

 I may have a different version of ""sh"" than you do; the double quotes
 around the backticks work for my ""sh"".
 
 (In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
 safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
 I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
 names contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don't

 better yet would be a built-in server check on a periodic basis, even
 daily, looking for the existence of an update, and if found prompt the
 system admin to upgrade the server.  With the ever changing face of spam,
 this would probably be a big benefit to SA users and help keep everyone up
 to date.  We have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on
 www.RoseCitySoftware.com strictly because of joe-average-user concerns
 about spyware and ""phoning home"", but in cases where the app needs to
 access the internet anyhow, we have done it with great success and minimal
 concern by our users.

 	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
 virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
 through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling ""Show
 unseen message count in folder cache"". Where is that? And in what version?
 (I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)
 
 	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
 Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
 it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my 
 ~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the
 settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded
 state, etc. 
 	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
 1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
 	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:
 
 NEW: exmh.Exmh
 NAME: exmh
 CLASS: Exmh
 NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
 NAME: unseen
 CLASS: UnseenWin
 DESKTOP: 0
 RES: 1600 1200
 WH: 114 173
 XY: 1655 150 0 0
 LAYER: 4
 STICKY: 1
 SKIPTASK: 0
 SKIPWINLIST: 0
 SKIPFOCUS: 0
 SHADE: 2
 BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE
 
 	I changed:
 XY: 1655 150 0 0  	to 
 XY: 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space,
 restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
 There was my window! 
 
 	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that
 window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:
 
 NEW: exmh.Exmh
 NAME: exmh
 CLASS: Exmh
 NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
 NAME: unseen
 CLASS: UnseenWin
 BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE
 
 	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
 it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off
 screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
 shading.)
 
 	Hmm. Weird. 
 
 	Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be
 useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-)

 I think it's fine, in general, just so long as no-one checks in anything
 that puts it into my test corpus.
 
 Or alternately, whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer. 
 I know my mail host (interlink) runs SA, but I also run it, with my own
 set of rules and scores. I don't want my spam-filter to be getting messed
 up by an upstream spam filter.

 One practice I've adopted is to list Requires: only when they're
 absolutely necessary.  This will help because some packages are named
 differently between distributions (eg. SDL <-> libSDL), and the
 dependencies are automatically handled by RPM by depending on shared
 library names.
 
 This doesn't apply to BuildRequires: though.
 
 Use macros for directory names where available, eg %{_libdir},
 %{_bindir}, %{_datadir} etc.
 
 I'd like to suggest using as many RPM macros for command names as
 possible too, but unfortunately I don't know of a definitive reference
 about them...
 
 I have a small RedHat 7.3 RPM/apt repository at
 <http://cachalot.ods.org/>, and I've received reports from people
 running Mandrake 8.x and SuSE that the RPMs work with them out of the
 box.

 Secure and at ease
 ByJack Mccarthy
 August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PT
 
 MAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
 in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
 where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
 late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
 co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
 of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
 transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
 company for a king's ransom.
 
 Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.
 
 A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
 Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
 mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
 passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
 PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
 company.
 
 ""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
 says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""
 
 Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
 focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
 fortune.
 
 ""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
 processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
 it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
 The trade-off is fundamental.""
 
 Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
 e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
 accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
 service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
 more than 3 million business accounts.
 
 Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
 PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
 Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
 companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
 of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.
 
 Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
 areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""
 
 Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
 ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
 participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.
 
 ""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
 one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
 Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20
 
 PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
 Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
 exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
 covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.
 
 ""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
 susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
 Litan says.
 
 To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
 that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
 says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
 work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
 work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
 arrived.""

 It's official: Gretchen, Sprocket, and I will be moving in a few
 weeks. Not too far, though. We'll be going deeper into the city of
 San Francisco starting on the first of September. Lori and Norm
 were here over the weekend (for a photo shoot); in between sets,
 Gretchen invited them to join her hunt. They came upon a house
 located in one of the busier parts of town. With only street
 parking available, I wasn't too thrilled about investigating the
 property. However, my wife seemed optimistic. We kinda knew what
 we were looking for in a residence (and its neighborhood), but
 also knew we'd have to make certain concessions in the process. We
 parked (literally) up the hill and found our way to what would
 turn out to be our future home (at least, for the next year or
 so). It has lots of usable space - which is a premium here. Plus,
 the landlords are extremely dog-friendly. Winner! The pictures and
 videos will come, never fear.

 First order of business: get broadband! According to AT&T's Web
 site, cable modem service is not available in the area. However,
 DSL is an option. So, it looks like I'm going to be purchasing an
 external <A HREF=""http://lockergnome.pricegrabber.com/search_gen.php?form_keyword=dsl%20modem"">DSL
 modem</A> in a few days. Any suggestions?
 Yeah, I'm not even sure who I'll select for my provider. They
 currently use SBC to get online, so I might just stick with them
 for continuity's sake. Verizon has been solid enough for me here,
 but I believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. If I
 could make contact with someone from any capable system, I'd
 probably go with them. I should probably get the ball rolling
 soon, though - I'd hate to play the waiting game for too long.
 I've heard of installation nightmares, so I'll probably be rolling
 my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any
 real work done. When you download as much as I do, every bit
 counts. Oh, and did I tell you about the bites?
 
 <p>
 
 
 There are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every
 direction. Plus, we're right up around the corner from a Peet's
 outlet! If you need me, you know where you can find me. I'll
 probably also be setting up a Wi-Fi network before too long, too.
 My Proxim hardware still works, but I wasn't sure if I needed a
 crossover cable to connect it to my router. Furo tells me: ""If the
 hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between
 the two, as it provides the crossover for you. If both have uplink
 and non-uplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you
 would need a crossover cable between like ports. For instance, if
 you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation
 port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. Same for uplink to
 uplink."" How's that for home network helpfulness? Oh, if only he'd
 do a free <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"">Gnometome</a> for
 us...

 snapshot, and THEN I can print it. Too many steps, too much of my
 time! With Print!, I just hit my ""Print Screen"" key and out comes
 my screenshot without involving any other programs. Don't want a
 screenshot of your whole desktop? Not a problem, just press Alt +
 Print Screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only.
 Print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your
 printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire!
 Other features include scaling, centering, and the ability to
 invert images. (So, not only will you save time, you'll also save
 on toner. Bonus!)  You may also want to note that Print! saves
 your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings
 in your other programs. You'll definitely get your money's worth
 with this program. Don't believe me? Start by checking out the
 evaluation version for yourself!

 Gretchen is a self-professed pack rat: there are just some things
 that she can't throw away. For example, books. I, on the other
 hand, prefer my text in an electronic medium, and don't really
 miss those analog versions. (What's that stuff called again?
 Paper?) Many of my books are gathering dust on the bookshelf. The
 alternative? Free them into the wild! BookCrossing is essentially
 a worldwide book club. You register online and get a BookCrossing
 ID number to put on your books with a note sending the new reader
 back to BookCrossing (think of wheresgeorge.com). Then you just
 leave the book ""in the wild"" to be found by someone else; the
 folks at BookCrossing suggest a park bench, the pocket of an
 airplane seat, or just plain giving your book to a friend. ""Sounds
 easy, right? Well it is. It's also a fascinating exercise in fate,
 karma, or whatever you want to call the chain of events that can
 occur between two or more lives and one piece of literature. Oh,
 and we should mention, it's absolutely free and absolutely
 private, too."" BookCrossing also offers book reviews, ratings, and
 recommendations.

 Any modem that relies on Windows to function is dubbed a
 ""Winmodem."" Most manufacturers use ""Winmodems"" because they are
 cheap and easy to set up on a standard model PC. I don't have any
 problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a
 capitalistic society, I would hope that the savings would trickle
 down to ME in one way or another). I do, however, have a problem
 with the way ""Winmodems"" function after you add more internal
 devices to your PC. ""Winmodems"" rely on Windows to mediate their
 serial communication (I/O address, COM port, IRQ, etc.) and as you
 can imagine, the more devices Windows has to manage, the higher
 the probability of running into a problem. And what if you want to
 run Linux instead? Will the ""Winmodem"" function well, if at all,
 in an operating system other than Windows? Don't bet on it! If you
 want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your
 system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. How can you
 determine this? Checking a modem's system requirements. If the
 modem says it REQUIRES Windows, then keep looking... you've found
 yourself a ""Winmodem."" However, if the system requirements for the
 modem say that it will work with Linux, then you've found yourself
 a hardware modem. Yes, it IS that easy.

 0. INTRO.  [IBM DB2]

 2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE.
 3. BE A SF.NET FOUNDRY GUIDE.
 4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
 5. SITE STATISTICS
 
 
 0. INTRO
 
 Hello SourceForge.net Users,
 
 This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
 large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
 the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
 These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
 management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
 dependent website.
 
 Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
 a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
 the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
 70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
 growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
 the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
 press release here:
 
 http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html
 
 How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
 difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
 SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
 phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
 the databases advanced capabilities.
 
 Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
 site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.
 
 If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
 please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
 appreciate the feedback.
 
 Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
 Open Source Community.
 
 Pat-
 
 Patrick McGovern
 Director, SourceForge.net
 
 
 
 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY
 
 SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
 is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
 ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
 community can always obtain the software released by hosted
 projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
 download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
 as to provide better download times regardless of which network
 provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.
 
 Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
 further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
 additions include servers hosted by:
 
 Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
 http://www.twtelecom.com/
 
 University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
 http://www.umn.edu/
 
 CESNET (Czech Republic)
 http://www.cesnet.cz/
 
 We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
 the needs of the Open Source community.
 
 On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
 an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
 SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
 know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net
 
 
 
 2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE
 
 SourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX
 Kernel Summit, held in June.  Listen to the Linux kernel master
 discuss such hot topics as kernel modules, virtual memory,
 block I/O, database scaling, security modules, and async I/O.
 You may find this audio repository at:
 
 http://linuxkernel.foundries.sourceforge.net/article.pl?sid=02/06/26/0116225
 
 
 
 3. CONTRIBUTE TO SOURCEFORGE.NET! BE A FOUNDRY GUIDE!
 
 Want to contribute to SourceForge.net, but you don't know how to
 code? Be a foundry guide!  Foundry guides get to hype the cool
 projects that they think are worth downloading and testing.
 A guide finds all the stuff on the web about their subject of
 choice, and gives it prominent placement.  How do you become a
 foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a
 topic that interests you; and send email to
 foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you
 are qualified to be a foundry guide.
 
 
 
 4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
 
 We have a new position for a senior web developer available at
 SourceForge.net.  We are looking for someone to help us maintain,
 upgrade, and add new features to SourceForge.net.  Ideal person has
 5+ years of development experience on high end, high volume

 EMAIL LIST REMOVAL:
 
 When the SF.NET team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
 replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
 You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
 phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
 there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
 volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
 hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
 weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
 a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

 Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
 Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
 By Andrew Marshall
 
 BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
 looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.
 
 ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
 my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
 knew then there was something special.""
 
 Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
 -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
 who is expecting their first child.
 
 Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
 in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
 often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
 in search of a wife.
 
 ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
 found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""
 
 Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
 touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
 the couple married.
 
 MR. MARRIAGE
 
 Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
 Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
 started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
 agency.
 
 Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.
 
 ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
 knowledge, they have all been successful.""
 
 Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
 require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
 Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
 looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.
 
 Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
 office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
 language problems.
 
 ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
 Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""
 
 After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
 each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
 client has found a potential wife.
 
 ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
 think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
 usually within the next year.
 
 Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
 Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
 than 10 percent have broken up.
 
 Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
 arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.
 
 ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
 impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
 down, OK, we'll talk.""'
 
 But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
 and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
 for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
 stress disorder.
 
 WHY?
 
 Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
 say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
 form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
 impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.
 
 But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
 no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
 everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
 need Wan,"" he said.
 
 ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
 secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
 with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
 their future husband.""
 
 Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
 choose to use his agency.
 
 His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
 over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
 singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
 not ""God's gift to women.""
 
 Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
 own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.
 
 ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
 or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
 Impossible,"" she said.
 
 ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
 good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
 ladies from other countries.""
 
 Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
 the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
 not a major obstacle.
 
 ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
 a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
 couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
 dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
 very quickly.""
 
 Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
 to the West.
 
 ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
 how to eat, and when to make tea.""
 
 PITFALLS
 
 But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
 Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
 back in Bangkok, sad and angry.
 
 ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
 happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
 spoke to me.""
 
 Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
 there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""
 
 Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
 unsuitable candidates are weeded out.
 
 ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
 comers.""
 
 Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
 arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
 looking for a foreign husband.
 
 ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
 Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

 The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
 of the speakers choice.
 
 Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
 pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,
 but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is
 pretty weak.

 This is driving me nuts. I'm trying to run a once off mirror of a
 website using wget. It's ignoring images and not recursing links (even
 though I've specified the --mirror flag).
 
 wget --mirror https://username:password@foobar.com/a/b/a/index.html
 
 Any ideas or alternative tools?

 THE NEXT WORLD ORDER
 by NICHOLAS LEMANN
 The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.
 Issue of 2002-04-01
 Posted 2002-03-25
 
 When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people
 often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone
 suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush
 Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a
 father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe
 that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has
 resumed its governance-and about time, too.
 
 The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or
 worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.
 Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and
 foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as
 Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.
 Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in
 Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton
 of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
 commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this
 Administration also served under the President's father. They took office
 last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting
 by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.
 
 Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration
 foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval
 Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose
 cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the
 world, and these words:
 
 Defense Strategy for the 1990s:
 The Regional Defense Strategy
 Secretary of Defense
 Dick Cheney
 January 1993
 
 One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is
 communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected
 politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform
 publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
 are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,
 and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go
 to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to
 explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior
 official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a
 high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing
 Carnegie Hall?
 
 After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of
 Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign
 policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose
 existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at
 a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of
 Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior
 foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of
 conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and
 intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald
 Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has
 been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin
 Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a
 competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine
 American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which
 each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President
 Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the
 new grand strategy.
 
 Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense
 that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and
 Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but
 his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,
 perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't
 get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in
 the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,
 using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major
 foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that
 Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.
 
 The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the
 material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon
 envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent
 any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of
 controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being
 ""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials
 and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.
 
 As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney
 team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the
 senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before
 Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""
 meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the
 essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the
 world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of
 skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the
 same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global
 Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and
 is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the
 Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that
 the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the
 indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to
 preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary
 for the purpose.""
 
 When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around
 him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of
 the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which
 the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major
 foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a
 President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to
 connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the
 foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly
 because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating
 world affairs for any length of time.
 
 One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist
 attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.
 Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush
 has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic
 security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly
 entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that
 Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,
 aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in
 direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,
 especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress
 since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which
 his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of
 destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,
 because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive
 policymaking.
 
 Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a
 transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is
 not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials
 had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American
 public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at
 least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black
 Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the
 conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing
 Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign
 military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the
 options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999
 study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,
 which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the
 military or the civilian lite believes; for example, the study showed that
 the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to
 prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American
 death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September
 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.
 
 Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's
 Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United
 States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'
 in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the
 case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said
 immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes
 that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,
 she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons
 of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the
 national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to
 Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending
 terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the
 part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their
 standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does
 in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of
 missionary calm, rather than belligerence.
 
 In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,
 putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power
 balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she
 sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's
 Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the
 other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of
 the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the
 realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United
 States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to
 challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what
 you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to
 productive and coperative relations with the United States, rather than to
 try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters
 in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.""
 
 Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the
 National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do
 you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American
 doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I
 really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is,
 the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so
 clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big
 global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally
 thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the
 tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to
 seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of
 that before they harden again.""
 
 The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual
 document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals
 of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but
 not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the
 Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is
 working on the report now.
 
 ""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it
 in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,
 since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's
 important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior
 to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I
 would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real
 statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction
 that it's going.""
 
 It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant
 American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some
 questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being
 asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in
 foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender
 inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a
 couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive
 capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official
 adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of
 the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now
 in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,
 and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush
 Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it
 is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few
 months ago.
 
 Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested
 to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in
 foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or
 Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,
 and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he
 published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little
 fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he
 called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United
 States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.
 ""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It
 simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of
 the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the
 ""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.
 The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass
 argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not
 more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional
 great-power politics.""
 
 Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of
 Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-
 in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his
 office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an
 array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,
 beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and
 the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.
 
 It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that
 Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.
 ""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign
 policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case
 to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the
 economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very
 different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case
 that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security
 charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.""
 
 I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as
 Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from
 this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of
 ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the
 limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to
 massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.
 If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of
 the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone
 inside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,
 gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead
 to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can
 act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,
 and not if, you're going to be attacked.""
 
 Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American public
 needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said.
 ""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the
 case. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that
 this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.""
 
 On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still
 maintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long
 before called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a big
 difference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have to
 be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there are
 still limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on
 everyone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to
 join us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has
 to be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't
 send forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.""
 
 He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I think
 there is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.
 foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to
 certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to
 terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,
 democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies
 and then building institutions that lock them in even more.""
 
 The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new
 American foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What
 the United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's
 been done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the
 operation itself and in terms of its aftermath.
 
 Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
 the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of
 his aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,
 evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event
 was a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's
 leading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former
 Defense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely
 confident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mounting
 that the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing
 with Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete
 ""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his
 regime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.""
 
 Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a
 twinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit
 and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his
 supporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American
 support, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the
 Taliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in
 Washington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel
 military leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray
 over tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagon
 official told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's
 military is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been
 quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United
 States left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an
 internal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker
 now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could
 finish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea
 that a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of
 anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground
 troops.
 
 Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security
 Council's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton
 Administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by
 publishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.
 This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors
 published an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi
 National Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't
 think Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a
 substantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one
 we used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in
 Afghanistan.
 
 Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a
 briefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in
 Washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and
 walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were
 hanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using a
 pen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to three
 hundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the
 Tigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.
 ""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultan
 airbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier
 in Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointing
 again-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil
 fields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil
 fields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the
 Kurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, as
 fast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get the
 enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" His
 hand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack.
 
 That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed
 the government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously
 shaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,
 which before September 11th clearly met the new test of national
 unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass
 destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is
 not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel
 Pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence
 service, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,
 if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be
 established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no
 obvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn
 strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a
 nuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal
 affairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi
 Arabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become
 directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted
 to do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way
 that Europe was immediately after the Second World War.
 
 In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate
 moves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an
 indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's
 conservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is
 close to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance is
 futile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is
 intellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since
 September 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least
 the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance
 practically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the
 doctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone
 of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.
 
 The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with
 the Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,
 of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom
 see the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis
 was invited to the White House in December to brief the senior
 foreign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of the
 world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior
 official I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't
 proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it is
 prepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting
 thinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay
 declared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,""
 and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published
 an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in
 Iran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be
 accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)
 
 Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the
 nations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,
 if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to
 finish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic
 tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely
 absorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the
 Administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of
 the world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the
 United States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its
 actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure
 of international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test
 that policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that
 it can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly
 opposed the Iraq operation.
 
 When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked
 for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal
 2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve
 military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as
 an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on
 terrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of
 Iraq.
 
 This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about
 the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush
 builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the
 unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama
 involving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring
 and summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms
 that Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,
 are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the
 enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The
 Administration obviously feels confident that the United States can
 effectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop
 buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the
 Republican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam
 and topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a
 full-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will
 begin soon.
 
 Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's
 future-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now
 works in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the
 West Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of
 public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of
 his 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""Dick
 Cheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appears
 absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of
 the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly
 rumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of
 having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction
 which the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for
 those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only
 truly prudent course.
 
 When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before
 September 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been
 different. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,
 filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle
 East. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.
 
 ""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery
 of the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade
 Center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,
 former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a
 serious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar
 bombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy
 bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of
 the Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,
 and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the
 failure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.
 No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that
 long list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people
 from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our
 interests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged
 further aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,
 and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise
 up and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend
 themselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are
 morally weak.' ""
 
 Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been
 standard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done in
 Afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of
 Congress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made it
 clear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in
 expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.
 He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And
 he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to
 begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is
 not a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.
 There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could
 have waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged
 in long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new
 relationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so
 afraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could
 go on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,
 instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while
 standing up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know
 yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not
 only with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the
 states of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the
 states of Southwest Asia more generally.""
 
 We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein
 unacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,""
 Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass
 destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their
 promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made
 in '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems
 I listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq
 was given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to
 take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""
 
 ""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regime
 will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?""
 
 He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke
 slowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have
 confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""

 For goddess' sake Martin that seems to be exactly what you're doing.  You 
 started your reply to Tim's posting of the Guardian article by suggesting that 
 it was factually inaccurate.  Did you actually read it or did you just assume 
 that if the Grauniad writes about a Muslim extremist they must be making him out 
 as an all round nice guy?

 er, i understood you until you reached the above. Maybe its my lack of PHP 
 but why would a variable name _need_ to end with [] ?
 
 With most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come out 
 with either variables or an array / hash, which you then work with and name 
 whatever you like.

 The kind of restaurant advertised as 'just three minutes from this cinema' 
 which
 clearly nobody ever goes to and, even if they had ever contemplated it, have
 certainly changed their mind since seeing the advert.

 Hi, 
    I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
 unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
 from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
 executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
 problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
 to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?
 
 Thanks

 Could this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the
 humanoid cells are in fact exo-skeletally structured with more atoms
 per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance-squared tensile strength
 enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the
 lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel?  
 
 This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically
 (several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need
 to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or
 carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under
 weight).  Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the
 mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from
 bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength
 cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the
 muscular enhancement.
 
     E> As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK
     E> not really well explained in the comic series. 
 
 If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure
 modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to
 think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then
 what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened
 cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout
 the entire nervous system.  
 
 Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly
 hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal
 sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ...  for Peter Parker,
 everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle
 hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;
 don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus
 would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the
 heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We
 know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time
 was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself
 already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence
 his disorientation (""You ok, Mister?"") as if it was a hallucination.
 
 Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine
 if Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological
 'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological
 perception of his self had not, ie, ""Peter"" was not ""Spiderman"" but
 just the ""driver of the bus"".  Only, unlike ourselves, he found his
 self driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his
 cognitive time-scales.

 Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.
 
 Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
 this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.

 No software developer is immune to bugs. Even the cleanest code
 will have to go through a debugging process, but some debuggers
 are more efficient than others. Check out Download.com's

 Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,
 there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
 add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major
 ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool
 that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
 masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file
 for ease of distribution.<p>

 Need to add zip capability to your apps? Create and
    decompress zip archives with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX
    control. The control provides easy access to individual files
    stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within
    the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual
    files or files matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to
    any directory, and the control's memory management allows any
    size file to be compressed or decompressed in a constant
    memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly
    from memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files
    with wildcarding. There's even a real-time progress monitor
    for zip and unzip operations. Chilkat supports Active Server
    Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, and all
    languages that use ActiveX controls.

 Distribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with
    VB-PowerWrap. VB-PowerWrap embeds all dependent and
    non-dependent files into the executable of your VB program,
    including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,
    to create a single clickable application. VB-PowerWrap scans
    a VB project, wraps the appropriate files, and creates a
    self-contained file for distribution. In addition,
    VB-PowerWrap compresses all DLLs and OCXs and registers
    appropriate controls on the user's machine if needed. It
    works with Visual Basic 4, 5, and 6.

 Yep, those that win battles collect tthe spoils.  Lead and breed.  Want it to be

618,"As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, but
 I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,
 and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.
 
 If a user has a line like:
 
 whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.com
 
 in his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,
 tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
 yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
 the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail
 to be ignored?  I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on
 yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above
 line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is
 still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
 expect to trigger SA.
 
 Thanks in advance for any help.

 Easy.
 
 First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this
 may not play well with recent changes.  (I did look at 2.5.1, too).
 And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it
 (**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.
 
 Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:
 
 *Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
 *Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur
 *Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeen
 
 Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and 
 arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
 in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook""
 under Prefs->Hacking Support)
 
 It's going to look something like this:
 
 proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
     global exmh pick msg
     Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
     Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
     set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...]
     busy PickMarkSeen
     Exmh_Status ok blue
 }
 
 (that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)
 
 You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of
 time!

 ~sigh~  I'd already found that and checked it in....apparently I did so after 
 you checked it out and before you sent this mail...I hoped I was fast enough 
 that you wouldn't see it.

  Hmm. Yeah, mutt sorta calls the sendmail program directly. But I thought
 it would be very crap if the auth details (username, password) had to be
 hardcoded into the sendmail.cf (and damned if I can work out how to do
 that anyway).

 Right, there was definitely a relatively high density in Mexico, and
 much less elsewhere.  Population estimates vary wildly and about all
 your average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark
 figures.  While Central America may have had 20 or 30 million, vast
 areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very
 sparsely e.g., the plains Indians in what is now the U.S. may have
 been 2 million or so.
 
 There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from
 20 something million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th century,
 certainly, in part due to infectious diseases new and old, and other
 factors, and was probably in decline before contact.  Others claim it
 declined from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduce 95%
 mortality from imported diseases, and have a pretty clear agenda which
 makes me (for one) take their claims with a large grain of salt.
 
 About all that is certain is that anyone alive in 1500 was dead in 1600,
 in the Americas or elsewhere.

 I don't know about this /particular/ mood, but I have used
 neuro-conditioning with aiding children in stressful
 life-circumstances.
 
 Basically, you somehow evoke the state you want, and when you get it,
 you do something odd, anything at all will do, but I used a gentle
 ""vulcan grip"" on their shoulder.  Later, when faced with the
 uncomfortable situation, you can retrieve /part/ of that earlier more
 desireable state by giving them the pinch; it's not perfect (like you
 get with simpler brains) but it is an inescapable effect.
 
 This is probably the neuro-effect that leads to performance-enhancing
 superstitions such as Bob Dylan not performing without his favourite
 jean jacket: Because it provides the cue to a more relaxed mental
 state, he really does play better with it than without it.

 <font size=3><b>Techs fall again with telecoms, Dow drops below 8K</b></font><br>
 The day after WorldCom Group filed for bankruptcy protection, telecom shares suffered and helped drag down the tech sector.
 <p>
 BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook.  With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.
 <p>
 With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.

 Tyco International Ltd.'s earnings release on Tuesday may very well be the last for Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, whose tenure has been marred by his close association with the conglomerate's disgraced former chairman.
 Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading. But perhaps more important, Swartz was a key adviser and architect in Dennis Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's largest manufacturing conglomerates.<br><B>TYCO INTERNATIONAL 11.85 -5.12% </B><br>

 * Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
 
 Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
 SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
 address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
 place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
 state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
 Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
 It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.
 
 The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
 reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
 action in the Senate.
 
 CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
 more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
 last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.
 
 Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
 with S.630:
 
  http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml
 
 We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
 hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
 the entire Internet community can support.

 * European Union bans spam
 
 GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE
 
 May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
 (CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
 Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
 by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
 practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
 Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
 directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
 other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
 have a preexisting business relationship.
 
 ""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
 Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
 Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
 the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
 privacy of Europeans.""
 
 While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
 in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
 of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.
 
 ""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
 including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
 of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
 a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
 Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
 network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
 advertising.""
 
 ""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
 European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
 European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
 members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
 translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""
 
 More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
 Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,
 and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
 <http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>. More information on
 the international CAUCE network of affiliate organizations is

 Ahh, wonderful!  Just tried out these and *finally* got sound working
 with my Abit TH7II-RAID's integrated audio.  I've been pulling hair
 together with the (helpful) OpenSound people for quite some time now,
 but we've failed to get sound to work, either with the drivers included
 in kernel, or the commercial OSS.
 
 Thanks a *lot* !  The RPMs seem to be fine, they worked for me out of
 the box (on vanilla Valhalla w/latest errata).

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ""I. Description
 
    The  CERT/CC  has received confirmation that some copies of the source
    code  for  the  Sendmail  package have been modified by an intruder to
    contain a Trojan horse.
 
    The following files were modified to include the malicious code:
 
      sendmail.8.12.6.tar.Z
      sendmail.8.12.6.tar.gz
 
    These  files  began  to  appear  in  downloads  from  the  FTP  server
    ftp.sendmail.org  on  or  around  September  28,  2002.  The  Sendmail
    development  team  disabled  the  compromised FTP server on October 6,
    2002  at  approximately  22:15  PDT.  It  does  not appear that copies
    downloaded  via  HTTP contained the Trojan horse; however, the CERT/CC
    encourages  users  who  may  have  downloaded the source code via HTTP
    during  this  time  period  to take the steps outlined in the Solution
    section as a precautionary measure.""
 
      OK, it's now time to work out the PGP securing of apt repository traffic. I've never gotten anything but ""sitename.whatever will not be authenticated"" until running Redhat 8.0 when I get something about having ""No Key"" for various files.
 
     What's it take to ensure we're covered against this kind of childish/moronic/Microsoft-era problems?

 No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
 Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
 right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
 requests have in the entire past year.
 
 One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
 adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
 indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
 not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
 I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
 addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
 a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
 same box).
 
 For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
 instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
 _still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
 we've been there.)

 mplayer works with dga (if i am root) and works with x11
 and always worked with sdl (but not now with redhat 8)
 now it gives black screen window and play the music of the movie.

 I don't think there is a specific word in English for eye goop. 
 However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is
 a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it:
 muta, pronounced ""MOO-ta"".  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I
 automatically use that word for ""eye goop"" when speaking English (how
 often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a
 linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into
 my vocabulary.
 
 Not that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted ""muta"" into
 my version of the English language as the word for ""eye goop"".  Arguably
 better than ""smegma"" anyway.

 This year's <a href=""http://www.sic.org"">SIC</a> gets the blame for the 
 lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
 software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
 demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
 to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
 faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
 e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
 exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
 sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.
 <p>
 One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
 is Nick Bradbury's release of 
 <a href=""http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp"">TopStyle 3.0</a>. 
 Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
 family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
 roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
 hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
 previously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
 just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
 the next two issues.

 as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.
 
 But you knew that.
 
 When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
 children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
 rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.
 
 I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there
 aren't any.
 
 If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or
 death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.  That won't stop
 them or you from pretending otherwise.

 LESSON 2: COMPANIES GONE WRONG
 
 Instructors: Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt)
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690055
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690056
 
 In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant
 sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with
 current events surrounding the companies you hold.
 
 Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing
 Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one
 reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly
 don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.
 
 Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have
 significantly more access to business management than we ever
 will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable
 insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of
 company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond
 market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.
 
 In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is
 slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly
 valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large
 share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple
 of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is
 priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple
 company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business
 starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,
 whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,
 it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a
 company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.
 
 So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to
 go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning
 signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.
 
 WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH
 Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of
 the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best
 capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the
 market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted
 revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April
 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the
 next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)
 company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in
 a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a
 barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.
 
 Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest
 sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they
 always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then
 canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If
 you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and
 they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell
 trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give
 a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on
 the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a
 year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a
 year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly
 growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew
 sequential growth.)
 
 WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH
 By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs
 were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies
 growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom
 lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales
 were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end
 of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%
 to 40%.
 
 Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to
 collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics
 changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock
 reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the
 technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see
 signs that something was wrong.
 
 WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS
 In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings
 perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look
 at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free
 cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have
 significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash
 flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999,
 Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,
 based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the
 world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications
 equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058
 
 But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were
 afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an
 operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost
 $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in
 reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than
 $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference
 between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating
 cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3
 billion, and not in a good way.
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059
 
 The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have
 saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,
 Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but
 twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow
 is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)
 
 And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on
 Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they
 weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.
 
 WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS
 Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's
 because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's
 almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best
 interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the
 same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.
 
 Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally
 paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the
 current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds
 bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I
 recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of
 the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders
 are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same
 time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!""
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061
 
 I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company
 and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity
 between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced
 at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value
 interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some
 bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be
 lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.
 But some are priced below face value, even way below.
 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062
 
 As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at
 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance
 they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent
 problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with
 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not
 one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports
 a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than
 Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they
 don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.
 
 WARNING SIGN 5: ""IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER""
 For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the
 largest company in the world by market capitalization. This
 should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the
 stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion
 implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach
 $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings
 higher than $12 billion in a single year.
 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063
 
 As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --
 it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that
 article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any
 better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no
 signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,
 Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8
 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of
 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then
 66% higher.
 
 Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine
 a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for
 future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the
 midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As
 investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.
 Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this
 point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business
 was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot
 has to be right for the situation to work out.
 
 HOMEWORK
 For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after
 Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you
 looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,
 do the following:
 
 - Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four
   quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,
   staying about the same, or weakening?
 
 - Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past
   four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing
   slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?
 
 - Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past
   three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net
   income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look
   at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around
   due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much
   more indicative of real cash flow trends.)
 
 - If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center
   and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know
   whether your company has any debt, just type your company name
   into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
   http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064
 
 - Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its
   current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is
   there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario
   already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,
   this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's
   still a question you should consider.)

 Bill Mann, TMF Otter</a> (with <a href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690013"">Matt Richey, TMF Matt</a>)
 
 <br /><br />
 <P>In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold.
 <BR><BR>Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.</P>
 <P><STRONG><STRONG></STRONG></STRONG></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 1: Slowing sales growth <BR></STRONG>Through 2000, <STRONG>Nokia</STRONG> (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.)</P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth <BR></STRONG>By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong. <EM><EM></EM></EM></P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flows<BR></STRONG>In 1999, <STRONG>Lucent</STRONG> (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690014"">operating cash flow</A> and <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690015"">free cash flow</A>. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>But as Matt and I <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690016"">detailed in January 2000</A>, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company <EM>lost</EM> $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of <EM>$1.8 billion</EM>.)</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds</STRONG> <BR>Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690017"">log sheet</A> where you write down the price of the bond. <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690018"">Download it here</A>. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!""</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>I recommend the <A href=""http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690019"">Yahoo! Bond Center</A>. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even <EM>way</EM> below.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>As of this writing, <STRONG>WorldCom</STRONG> (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. <STRONG>Tyco</STRONG> (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. <STRONG>Qwest</STRONG> (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Warning sign 5: ""It just doesn't get any better""</STRONG> <BR>For a brief time in 2000, <STRONG>Cisco Systems</STRONG> (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690020"">As I wrote</A> in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had <EM>ever</EM> generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P><STRONG>Homework<BR></STRONG>For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following:</P>
 <P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating, staying about the same, or weakening?
 <BR><BR>
 <LI>Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?
 <BR><BR>
 <LI>Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much more indicative of real cash flow trends.)
 <BR><BR>
 <LI>If your company has long-term debt, go the <A href=""http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690021"">Yahoo! Bond Center</A> and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know whether your company has any debt, just type your company name into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
 <BR><BR>
 <LI>Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market, this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's still a question you should consider.) </LI></UL>
 <P></P>
 <P>To help you out, we've put together the <STRONG>Foolish Stock Information Form</STRONG> to track all of your research and information about your stocks. You can get to by <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690022"">clicking here</A>. We've also outlined how to find all of the information above, <a href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690023"">here</a>.</P>
 <P></P>
 <P>So dust off the old calculator, find your company's financials, and get to work. Quarterly financial data is best found in company 10-Qs, and annual data is best found in company 10-Ks. You should be able to find all of this information using financials from either the company website or at Fool.com on the <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690024"">Quotes & Data</A> area. </P>
 <P><STRONG>Feeling a little lost?<BR></STRONG>If you're new to using SEC filings, read this <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690025"">overview of financial statements</A>. Above all else, just do your best. Once you've done what you can, report your findings to your teammates! We've also put together an ongoing list of resources so you can dive in a little deeper.

 This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
 response to this elsewhere.
 
 I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
 gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).
 
 bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
 be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
 delivery.
 
 As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
 balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
 before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.
 
 But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
 believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
 never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?
 
 Thanks,

 Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad. 
 Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?
 
 Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
 or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
 programming syntax
 to make sure people use loops or recursion?
 <<To iterate is human, to recurse divine>>
 
 Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.
 For example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?
 
 Hmm.

 The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
 Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
 appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
 really think I'm going to pick this up. 
 
     That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
     competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
     spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
     high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
     surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
     time is another story -- more on that later.) 
 
     Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
     will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
     hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are 
     supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
     clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
     own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 
     34-year-old demographic."" 
 
 I am that demographic! Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)

 I suppose this could finish over the course of an afternoon.  Now where's
 ""somewhere""?  I expect we'll eventually collect several datasets;
 SourceForge isn't a good place for it (they expect projects to distribute
 relatively small code files, and complain if even those get big).

 What then are we training the classifier to do?  Graham's scoring scheme is
 based on an assumption that the ham-vs-spam task is *easy*, and half of that
 is due to that the ham has a lot in common.  It was an experiment to apply
 his scheme to all the comp.lang.python traffic, which is a lot broader than
 he had in mind (c.l.py has long had a generous definition of ""on topic""
 <wink>).  I don't expect good things to come of making it ever broader,
 *unless* your goal is to investigate just how broad it can be made before it
 breaks down.

 Which is ""a feature"" from Graham's POV:  the more clues, the better this
 ""smoking guns only"" approach should work.

 You can't; hard links only. And those get cleaned up by ScanDisk as
 ""cross-linked files"". Shortcuts are the Windows analogue of symlinks,
 and they don't work outside the Windows environment - i.e. they're an

 I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most
 other people.  And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless
 and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter
 don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population.  Hell, I
 grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember
 quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly
 wasn't because of The Man.  And my parents were poor because they made
 lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. 
 Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience.
 
 And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense
 and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People
 who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't
 manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools.  It
 isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots
 of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making
 lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being
 wealthy.

 You are using a very narrow definition of ""smart"".  Smart doesn't make
 you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.
 Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote
 their energy elsewhere than being ""rich"".  But I don't know too many
 really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.

 It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of
 what wealthy people are like.  Hint: they are exactly like you and me,
 but with a higher net worth.  In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds
 of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very
 hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are
 completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy).  ""Old wealth"" is
 incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three
 generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually
 long-lived exceptions.
 
 It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort
 into it.  However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and
 expend a lot less energy.  Virtually all the people I know who are
 wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and
 exaggerated amounts of drive.  Most people would not consider those
 people's lives ""fun"", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.

658,"Hi,
 
 some time now the following messages were haunting me:
 
      automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude
 
 It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
 up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.
 
 # grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
 Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
 Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
 Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
 Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
 ...
 
 I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
 himself is ""dude"", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
 directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
 many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.
 
 Regards, Axel.

 The best I can think of is to figure out what the command being 
 issued by exmh is that selects and inserts the sig and bind that to a 
 key sequence.  That shouldn't be *too* difficult, it's just a matter 
 of figuring out the tcl (something my perl-based brain isn't excited

 Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
 Pipeline[1] 
 
 Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
 oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
 him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
 begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
 to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
 9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. 
 
 Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
 Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
 for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
 rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
 because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. 
 
 Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
 carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
 carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
 gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
 after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
 opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
 Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. 
 
 ""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
 right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
 justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
 friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
 influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
 advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
 Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
 cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""

 Perhaps more useful would be if Tim could check in the pickle(s?)
 generated by one of his training runs, so that others can see how
 Tim's training data performs against their own corpora.  This could
 also be the starting point for a self-contained distribution (you've

 seems just as good as anything else).

 For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the
 dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global
 temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are
 melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. That is,
 people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate
 explanation (hint: climate variability doesn't cover all the bases).

 In essence, hindsight justification.  The progressives weren't in the
 middle, they were in a society at one end and they wanted a society at
 the other end.  The middle is more or less where they got stopped.
 
 As to an intervention that worked, I actually have some nice things to
 say about the SEC, at least in theory.  I have a few nasty things to say
 as well, but on the whole it has been a very good thing.

 Michael's Minute: 
 Lindows.com Report Card 
 
 As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their
 report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of
 grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..
 
 <http://lindows.com/timeline> 
 To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click
 here <http://lindows.com/timeline> . 
 
 Operating System:  
 
 As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.
 One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com
 <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> , for as little as $299. This is a
 significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder
 (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the
 box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. 
 
 For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we
 offer the Insider program <http://www.lindows.com/signup> . This gives
 people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS
 as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about
 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow,
 consequently, this product is not yet for everyone. 
 
 Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart
 <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> when the program available directly
 from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is
 the Walmart <http://www.lindows.com/walmart>  computers are certified,
 ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much
 different than offering a software program that will work on any
 computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference
 between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus
 opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The
 first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job.
 
 While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS
 installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support
 a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B
   _____  
 
 Software: 
 
 Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on
 their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to
 add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school,
 home or business.
 
 Click-N-Run <http://www.lindows.com/clicknrun>  is the easiest way to
 load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system
 has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With
 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse
 <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> , users can find quality software
 titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click
 download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included
 in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point.
 Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future.
 Grade: A-
   _____  
 
 Microsoft Windows Compatibility:
 
 We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the
 legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to
 support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help
 people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers
 come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft
 applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel
 documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people
 to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit
 Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our
 Warehouse such as OpenOffice
 <http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_details.php?id=8966> . 
 
 Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since
 they're included in the Warehouse <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> .
 Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're
 investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based
 programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer
 support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to
 MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get
 better in the above areas.  Grade: B 
   _____  
 
 Communication:
 
 We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going
 which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute
 <http://www.lindows.com/mm> . While our overall goal has not deviated -
 Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more
 focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have
 told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing
 running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you
 detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs,
 forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating
 system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. 
 
 Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change
 the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library
 <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>  of 1,000+ software titles all for a
 flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to
 think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable.
 
 There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around
 - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address
 every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these
 in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about
 Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade:
 B+

 Bringing Choice to Your Computer! 
  
 LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being
 offered from Lindows.com  <http://www.lindows.com/builder> Builder
 partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download
 and preview to Lindows.com  <http://lindows.com/signup> Insider
 partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to
 install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The
 General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware
 and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an
 existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation
 process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a
 select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs. For more information

 The original comment's context was digital signatures. A digital signature
 is worth sqrat if any userspace app or rogue superuser code can grab your
 keyring in clear, and send out stuff in your name. A passphrase unlocking
 the keyring for that particular use is a minimal protection (since not
 immune to passphrase snarfers), but this is much, much better than always
 leaving your key in the lock. (Why then having at all the key, in the
 first place?)

 A passphrase is a (long, secure) password unlocking (decrypting) your 
 keyring. You don't use a passphrase to read your email. Unless it resides 
 on a crypto file system.

669,"Hello all,
 Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback
 that I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  I
 downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to
 the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I
 started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced
 some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?
 
 ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/
 local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url
 That worked fine so I moved to the next step.
 make
 At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:
 Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el
 make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255
 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'
 make: *** [w3] Error 2
 
 When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying
 that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are
 the commands I used.
 ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
 followed by the commands make and make install.
 There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so
 I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.
 
 Thanks again

671,"Ananova: 
 Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'
 
 Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
 keeping herds of insects.
 The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
 building materials.
 The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
 species called cryptostigma.
 Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
 stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
 The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
 scrape off and use for their nest.
 Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
 bees.
 Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
 turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
 Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
 their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
 research on how they tend to their herd.
 Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
 from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

672,"How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
 If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
 workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?
 
 As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
 into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
 be a lot of documentation around about it.
 
 Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
 Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
 config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
 have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
 the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.
 
 Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
 for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
 me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
 for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
 to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
 wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
 cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
 modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
 an NFS server on the network.
 
 Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
 cheers,
 deccy.

 As usual for me, this is an aggregate of 20 runs, each both training and
 predicting on 4000 c.l.py ham + ~2750 BruceG spam.
 
 Only 25 ham scores out of 80,000 are above 0.025 now (and, yes, the
 ""Nigerian scam""-quoting msg is still counted as ham -- I haven't taken
 anything out of the ham corpus since remving the ""If AOL were a car"" spam),
 the f-p rate wouldn't have changed at all if the spamprob cutoff were
 dropped from 0.90 to 0.675, dropping the cutoff to 0.40 would have added
 only 2 false positives, and dropping it to 0.15 would have added only
 another 2 more!
 
 It's spooky.

 Kevin ""Free Kevin"" Mitnick and Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak co-hosted an episode of The 
 Screen Saver on Tech TV, where Woz autographed one of the laptops that Kevin 
 got arrested for using. Now that machine, signed by both net-celebs, is up for 
 sale on eBay. 
 
     This is the Toshiba Satellite T1960CS, 486 laptop computer seized by the 
     FBI on February 15, 1995, in Raleigh, NC, during the arrest of the world's 
     most celebrated computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick. The laptop is working and 
     has been loaded with a fresh version of Windows 95. A shrink-wrapped 
     version of Windows 95 on floppy, is included with the laptop. The laptop is 
     a 486DX with a color LCD, detachable trackball mouse, AT&T 14.4 PCMCIA 
     modem card, power adapter and documentation in FBI evidence bags. The 
     laptop has been signed on the bottom by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple 
     Computer, and says, ""You've got the whole world in your hands. --Woz (Free 
     Kevin!). It is also signed by Mitnick himself. The system was shown on the 
     September 27, 2002 episode of The Screen Savers on TechTV, where the 
     signatures on the bottom were authenticated in a special show hosted by 
     Wozniak and Mitnick. A tape of the show will also be included.

 The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant 
 points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs.
 
 I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
 java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
 compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
 because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
 probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
 what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest.
 
 Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
 more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
 utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single 
 portable JVM that just works.
 
 My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze 
 browser java implementations.

 Note that I since got rid of bayes.ini (it's embedded in Options.py 
 now), so search-path issues won't burn you here anymore.  The intended 
 way to customize the tokenizer and testers is via creating your own 
 bayescustomize.ini.  You'll get burned by search-path issues wrt that

 Ah.  I had forgotten that was settable.  
 
 Preferences, Folder Display, ""Action when Target Button

 You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" 
 activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: 
 activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or 
 norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. 
 ""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of 
 distributions rather than averages.
 
 Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let
 there be three pairings which result in each person
 having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have 
 sex with the other two females. 
 
 Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners
 is equal between the sexes, tautologically. 
 
 But here more women than men are:
  - above the single partner threshold
  - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold
  - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners
  - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners
 
 And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) 
 number of partners.
 
 So in this contrived population, females are more 
 ""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is 
 defined uselessly.

 statement about VP Cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.
 
 I couldn't agree with you more on this: ""in short, then, economics is not a
 zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs
 of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit
 is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise,"" however, I resent being lumped
 in a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich and
 successful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning to
 understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad
 hominem (re Cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like ""if rich then
 deservedly"" or ""if rich then smarter.""  Given that, I am also beginning to
 understand why some people NEED to be rich.
 
 WRT to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies!  WRT Harvard: over 90% of
 2002 graduates were cum laude +. INTERESTING curve.  Those eager to be
 measured got their wish; those unwashed shy folk who just live it provide
 the balast.
 
 Speaking of Forbes, was reading about Peter Norton just today in an old
 issue while waiting for my doctor.  Norton attributes his success to LUCK.

 Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
 composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
 get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
 ""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...
 
 [Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
 like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
 you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
 *those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
 around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
 transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
 government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
 innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
 summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
 there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]
 
 
 The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
 ""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
 best school possible.
 
 Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
 for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
 ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
 years for proof.
 
 Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
 World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
 Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
 goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
 afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
 couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
 last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
 and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.
 
 
 The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
 degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
 learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
 basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
 death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
 who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
 smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.
 
 BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
 rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
 beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
 were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
 Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
 much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
 this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
 educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
 facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
 There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
 economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
 ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
 intelligence and effort.
 
 [I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
 competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
 apparently.]
 
 
 
 BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
 *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
 all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
 there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
 most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
 *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
 all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
 not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.
 
 That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
 People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
 stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
 apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
 know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
 in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
 extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
 doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
 politician as Santa Claus come election time...
 
 
 In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
 theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
 redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
 that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.
 
 To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
 wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

692,"I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the 
 behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I 
 also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh 
 window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select 
 it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
 recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and 
 leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no 
 longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
 behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what 
 I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more 
 specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:
 
 Application       What gets pasted
 
 XEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh
 xterm             same as XEmacs
 AbiWord           nothing
 Nedit             nothing
 sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten
 
 The last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
 obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets 
 pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted 
 and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).
 
 It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to 
 paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??

 Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
 We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
 Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks""
 (high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
 clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
 relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
 delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
 the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.

 We could have a server mode (someone described this as an SA option).

 Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
 engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
 Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
 sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
 months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
 lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
 every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
 to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
 design/programming issue.
 
 That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
 re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
 language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
 The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
 detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
 bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
 you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
 a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
 (or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
 Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
 could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
 raw performance scalability.

 Sounds snake-oilish to me, but I'm biased by lots of experience with firewalls and proxy servers, and the limitations thereof.

 > 
 > DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
 > ByScott Tyler Shafer
 > August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
 > 
 > DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
 > specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
 > process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes 
 > the data in 
 > hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater 
 > performance, 
 > according to company officials.
 > 
 > The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the 
 > first in a 
 > family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based 
 > startup. The 
 > DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
 > called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
 > data.
 > 
 > According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
 > conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
 > proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data 
 > between two 
 > businesses.
 > 
 > ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
 > ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
 > 
 > Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the 
 > file size up 
 > to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
 > application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
 > alternative.
 > 
 > In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
 > importance in the world of XML.
 > 
 > ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
 > said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
 > Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
 > 
 > Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
 > security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
 > 
 > According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
 > processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach 
 > the company 
 > itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with 
 > regards to speed 
 > and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
 > creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
 > 
 > ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
 > adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
 > said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
 > technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that 
 > he believes 
 > will be mostly false.
 > Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
 > accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes 
 > of a packet, 
 > while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 
 > 1,400 bytes 
 > and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
 > 
 > The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large 
 > collection of 
 > XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the 
 > markup language 
 > as they pass through the device.
 > 
 > The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
 > balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and 
 > will identify 
 > and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
 > 
 > In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an 
 > application 
 > co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators 
 > more granular 
 > control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
 > controls the device.
 > 
 > DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging 
 > market. Startup 
 > Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega 
 > XPE switch in 
 > May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, 
 > launched with a 
 > focus on content processing and acceleration.
 > The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at 
 > $54,995. The 
 > company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
 > field trails at a number of other enterprises.
 > 
 > ==============================================================
 > ===========
 > 
 > DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs 
 > since it was 
 > founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
 > foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
 > would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry 
 > interest in XML 
 > grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
 > designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
 > requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was 
 > a software 
 > interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML 
 > processing 
 > is still licensed by many companies for use in their own 
 > products today.
 > 
 > Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
 > developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team 
 > raised the bar 
 > and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built 
 > hardware. In 
 > 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
 > industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
 > 
 > Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
 > network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
 > Services. While other companies are just now marketing first 
 > versions of 
 > products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
 > providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
 > industry-leading customers and partners.
 > 
 > DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
 > brings decades of experience in the networking and computing 
 > industries, 
 > drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
 > Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

 You could try opening the directory with $filelist = popen(""ls -t
 <path/to/dir>"", ""r""). This should give you the filenames in the
 directory sorted by mod.time. You can then open each filename, and read
 filemtime() to get the mod.time.

 You can just recompile the apt source RPM, if it's the newer one. (Such
 as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.
 
 Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
 (Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
 boxes).
 
 Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a
 directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS? Say I have
 blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
 blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
 the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?
 
 Dave.

 To paraphrase something I heard once:
 Unless you like looking for a new job, never install a non-released or
 development-only version of software anywhere where the results of such
 code are important.
 
 ie: Don't run development code on a production machine. :)
 
 
 The problem isn't SA anyway, it looks for Razor1 and just keeps on
 going if it can't find it.  Something came up about amavis on the SA
 list where it looks for Razor itself...

 Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone

 Both keyboards have PS/2 connections and I want the keypad to be plugged in

 should take over.
 Possible?  Any possible hacks?

 No problems whatsoever. Currently apt.freshrpms.net is running 7.3 with apt

   Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web
   Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
   To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
   and Between Online Meetings
 
   Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
   users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network
 
   ###
 
   Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
   group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
   Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
   Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
   and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
   communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
   collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
   teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.
 
   With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
   world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
   the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
   between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
   to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
   meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
   copies of constantly changing documents.
 
   Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
   time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
   information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
   having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
   environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
   essential.
 
   Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
   sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
   recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
   actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
   can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
   will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
   inside or outside company firewalls.
 
   Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
   meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
   will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
   ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
   other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
   highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
   conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
   and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.
 
   ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
   services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
   Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
   of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
   global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
   maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""
 
   ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
   training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
   of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the
   communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure
   collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the
   best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""
 
   About Magi
   Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms
   today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration
   network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can

 The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
 -> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
 being issued and the responses.
 
 FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
 encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
 window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
 asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
 dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).

 EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
 Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
 By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
 
 WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
 sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
 Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.
 
 The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
 push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
 and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.
 
 While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
 exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
 animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
 risk to humans.
 
 ""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
 exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health
 effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
 uncertainties are involved.""
 
 The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
 world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
 significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
 emissions under the Clean Air Act.
 
 Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
 administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
 would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
 separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.
 
 EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
 the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
 the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
 the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
 meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.
 
 The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
 although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
 is expected to produce pollution reductions.
 
 The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
 probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
 diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
 gauging pollution health concerns.
 
 But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are
 considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
 cancer risk to an individual.
 
 Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal
 and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be
 carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
 environmental exposure.""
 
 The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
 short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
 ""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and
 other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
 as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.
 
 Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
 to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
 diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
 expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
 sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.
 
 Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
 environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to
 harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
 clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
 standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""
 
 Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
 Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is
 clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
 cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""
 
 The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
 the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
 turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.

 I may have a different version of ""sh"" than you do; the double quotes
 around the backticks work for my ""sh"".
 
 (In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
 safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
 I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
 names contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don't
 need special quoting.)

 Probably not.   Next time try clicking on the folder name in the
 sequences window for the sequence.   That is, request that sequence
 be the one displayed in the FTOC.   If the sequence doesn't exist,
 it will be cleaned up then.
 
 Perhaps it would be nicer if flist would do it as well, but this
 is effective enough.

 I really wanted to go to this, especially to look at XOPUS. 
 Unfortunately, we're launching a new intranet at work next week and I 
 couldn't get away. XOPUS + an XML native DB such as Xindice looks like 
 something that could hit a home run.

 I'm not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff.
 But the whole 'who in their right mind would use that? it doesn't have all
 these cool features!' isn't always a guarantee of failure - maybe there is a
 strength in this approach (agents and/or IM as ui) than can find a nich
 application space.

 Kind of like a web query - and with google, someone else can turn them into
 a link so you don't even have to type anything.

 Yes - true true.

 What about a situation where you don't directly ask/talk to the bot, but
 they listen in and advise/correct/interject/etc?
 example: two people discussing trips, etc. may trigger a weather bot to
 mention what the forecast says - without directly being asked.

 All of these ""af6"" are related to avifile6 support :-/
 Normally, my 0.6.1-fr2 build of transcode defaults to *not* use avifile,
 but you can use ""--with avifile6"" to force recompiling against it.
 
 Do you have an old avifile installed maybe?
 Can you check the ""./configure ..."" line run at the beginning of the
 rebuild process to see if it does include the ""--without-avifile6"" option?

 Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
 enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
 software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
 kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
 between the five different computers and have Internet 
 access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.
 
 <p>After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
 nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
 things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
 have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
 finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
 has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.
 
 <p>After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
 hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
 Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
 there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
 networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
 impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
 vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
 make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
 here]. 
 
 <p>Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
 keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
 The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
 construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
 and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
 that he'll have a front yard left by then.
 
 <p>The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
 I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
 Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
 drive home later since they were only getting started at 
 that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
 45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
 many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
 half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
 cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.
 
 <p>The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding 
 to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the 
 last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
 front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
 figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead. 
 
 <p>So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
 Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
 notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
 memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
 list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
 read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
 for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
 from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
 sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
 PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.

 <b>Satellite Internet Delays Add Up</b>
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm"">http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm</a>
 
 <p>Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet 
 provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype 
 paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
 really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
 some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
 is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
 down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
 place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
 hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
 common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
 milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
 connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
 being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
 ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
 paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
 explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
 over-satellite connections is quite informative.

 <p>Even encryption software is potentially exposed to

 to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed

 <p>You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
 explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
 There's a lot more to database management and development 
 than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
 reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
 the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
 ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
 usually results in additional work later.

 <li>Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU."" 
 
 <li>You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
 While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:
 
 <ol><li>Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
 <br><li>Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
 <br><li>Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.

 Across my data, all-caps DATE, SUBJECT, TO, etc indeed appear only in the

 Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe
 
 John Carvel, social affairs editor
 Wednesday August 28, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
 to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
 shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
 The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
 anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
 University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
 people's shape.
 The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
 inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
 the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
 It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
 taller than his French counterpart.
 The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
 only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
 advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
 The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
 with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
 1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
 Americans 1,626.7mm
 More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
 nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
 and 66.7 for women.
 The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
 inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
 806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
 1,047.2mm.
 The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
 largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
 smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
 The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
 the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
 Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
 outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
 However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
 compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
 compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
 The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
 available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
 longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
 average.
 The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
 counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
 Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
 occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
 The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
 open ring pull cans.

 Secure and at ease
 ByJack Mccarthy
 August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PT
 
 MAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
 in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
 where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
 late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
 co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
 of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
 transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
 company for a king's ransom.
 
 Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.
 
 A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
 Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
 mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
 passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
 PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
 company.
 
 ""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
 says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""
 
 Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
 focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
 fortune.
 
 ""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
 processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
 it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
 The trade-off is fundamental.""
 
 Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
 e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
 accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
 service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
 more than 3 million business accounts.
 
 Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
 PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
 Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
 companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
 of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.
 
 Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
 areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""
 
 Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
 ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
 participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.
 
 ""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
 one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
 Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20
 
 PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
 Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
 exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
 covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.
 
 ""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
 susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
 Litan says.
 
 To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
 that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
 says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
 work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
 work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
 arrived.""

743,"What I understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for
 the food and other items they acquired from the Muslim vendors -- then
 taunted them.
 
 That may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting
 light.  Taking food from a small vendor in India and not paying them is
 trying to starve them.
 
 It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of
 activists.
 
 I'm rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere.  Yet I find my sympathies
 with the Muslims in this case, even after they burned the train.

 Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being
 that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful
 nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to
 use it.

 You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
 edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
 /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
 back into place and you're ready to go.
 That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
 /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
 again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
 because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
 /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
 parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
 computers to work for example).

 Matthias

 The content suggests its more prank than vigilante activism (in the

 Here's hoping that tradition perseveres for the novelist
 currently on trial in Paris for calling Islam ""the stupidest
 religion""...
 
 http://ca.news.yahoo.com/020917/5/ozxa.html
 
 # Tuesday September 17 11:07 AM EST
 #
 # French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts
 # By Caroline Brothers
 #
 # PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq
 # faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred
 # by calling Islam ""the stupidest religion"" and its holy book the
 # Koran a depressing read.
 #
 # The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause
 # celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of
 # expression against religious sensitivities.
 #
 # The Muslim groups, which include the Mecca-based World Islamic
 # League and the Paris Mosque, accuse the writer of insulting Islam in
 # an interview with the literary magazine ""Lire"" during last year's
 # launch of his novel ""Plateforme.""
 #
 # Lire is also on trial over the remarks, which have taken on an added
 # significance in France in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity
 # and concern about Islam following the September 11 attacks by Muslim
 # radicals in the United States.
 #
 # Shortly after the trial started, 11 people in the courtroom stripped
 # off their shirts to reveal T-shirts saying ""No to the censure of the
 # imams"" and ""Marianne veiled, Marianne raped"" -- a reference to the
 # female symbol of the French republic.
 #
 # ""Freedom of expression! freedom of expression!"" they and other
 # Houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the
 # courtroom at the main law courts in central Paris.
 #
 # While intellectuals argued before the trial that Houellebecq should
 # be free to write what he wants, Lyon Mosque rector Kamel Kabtan
 # retorted: ""We are for freedom of expression, but not for insulting
 # communities.""
 #
 # BETE NOIRE
 #
 # Houellebecq, 45, the bete noire of contemporary French literature,
 # is no stranger to controversy. He offended conservatives and the
 # politically correct left with his 1998 novel ""Les Particules
 # Elementaires"" (""Atomised"" in English).
 #
 # Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted
 # once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme
 # admit he felt ""a quiver of glee"" every time a ""Palestinian
 # terrorist"" was killed.
 #
 # The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National
 # Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in
 # bringing Houellebecq to trial.
 #
 # France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying
 # Houellebecq's comments amounted to ""Islamophobia"" and deserved to be
 # sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination
 # and racism.
 #
 # The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading
 # trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former
 # official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for
 # sending Jews to death camps.
 #
 # RESTORING BLASPHEMY?
 #
 # Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case
 # effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact
 # that France as a secular state has no such law, and says
 # Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.
 #
 # He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour
 # conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the
 # article before it appeared.
 #
 # Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the
 # author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's
 # prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.
 #
 # The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached
 # style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to
 # love.
 #
 # Translated into 25 languages, ""Atomised"" incensed France's 1968
 # generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won
 # him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the
 # world's biggest fiction prizes.
 #
 # Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.

 <p><font size=3><b>How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet</b></font><p>
 Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said ""that was great, but you only told half the story"". You wanted to know two more things:
 <ol>
 <li>How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
 <li>How to secure the FTP Server
 </ol>
 There are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as ""Server Publishing"". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.
 <p>
 Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.
 <p>
 You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:
 <ol>
 <li>Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
 <li>Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
 <li>Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
 <li>Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
 <li>Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
 k OK
 <li>Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.
 </ol>
 The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic DNS service"". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.
 <p>
 There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.
 <p>
 Until next week,<br>
 Tom Shinder, Editor<br>

 <p><font size=3><b>Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers</b></font><p>
 Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:
 <ol>
 <li>Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
 <li>Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
 <li>Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
 <li>Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
 <li>That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
 <li>If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.
 </ol>
 This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?

 <p><font size=3><b>How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional</b></font><p>
 Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:
 <ol>
 <li>Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
 <li>Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
 <li>Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
 <li>The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
 <li>Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
 <li>Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in ""clear text"", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
 <li>Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
 <li>Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
 <li>Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
 <li>Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_<computername> account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.
 </ol>
 Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.

 I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a ""cumulative"" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another ""cumulative"" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to:<bR>

 <p><font size=3><b>Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows</b></font><p>
 If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:<br>

 If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!<br>

 <p><font size=3><b>Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!</b></font><p>
 It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to ""fix"" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.
 <p>
 Try this: go to:<br>
 <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo&"" target=""_top"">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo&</a><br>
 and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.

 Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that ""Repair"" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:
 <ul>
 <li>Sends an ipconfig /renew
 <li>Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
 <li>Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
 <li>Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
 <li>Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
 <li>Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdns
 </ul>

 Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent.

 You assume that they just match people up and marry them off, and neither is
 attracted to the other, which is not the case. Even this has arranged
 marrage beat by a long way.
 
 Males gets: A wife for a while, and if they actually like each other, for a
 long time.
 Female gets: Into Britan, out of a country with no real rights for women, no
 opportunities for her or her children, out of the polution, AIDS, and an
 uncountable number of scary tropical diseases. Not to mention in most cases
 living conditions that us spoiled Americans cannot even comprehend.
 
 Yea, the women is definately getting tha bad end of the deal here.

  Fake bank website cons victims
  
  West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
  service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
  more money out of people they had already hooked. 
  
  The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
  (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
  taken in by the fake website. 
  
  The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
  share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
  nations. 
  
  NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
  otherwise spot the scam. 
  
  Convincing site 
  
  News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
  unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
  their victims. 
 
  A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in
  front of the bank's name. 
  
  ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS
  spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
  online."" 
  
  Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
  behind it have not been caught. 
  
  NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
  
  The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
  other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 
 
  Domain games 
  
  Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
  419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
  cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
  
  The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
  crimes. 
  
  Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
  the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
  uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
  
  Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
  it. 
  
  NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
  London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
  
  Cutting edge fraud 
  
  Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
  legitimacy. 
  
  
  People tricked into clicking on fake sites
  
  But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
  place of the certificates. 
  
  ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
  technology,"" said the spokesman. 
  
  One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
  that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
  Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
  
  Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
  visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
  been deposited in their name. 
  
  But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
  asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
  
  Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
  priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
  
  Modern gloss 
  
  An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
  criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
  old cons a modern gloss. 
  
  The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
  forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
  months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
  
  He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
  true, undoubtedly is. 
  
  One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
  service Paypal. 
  
  Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
  and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
  
  The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
  people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

 Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast 
 amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not 
 only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected 
 need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work 
 together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to 
 be replaced witha more compatible method. This feature explores how Factor 5

 And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...
 
 delta$ mhparam pick

 Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
 one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
 one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

 the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but

 hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
 obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /

 I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
 something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
 particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
 Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.
 
 To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular

  Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
 and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5"" to 3.5"" IDE cable,
 and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the

 UCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary
 fellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr
 Noam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society
 awarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an
 insult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were
 given *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky
 apparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted
 songs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you're an
 admirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy
 or contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also
 appreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:

 Very special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for
 this one.

 Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-
 Budget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those
 cash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone?   Not if their
 Irish presence was as permanent and impressive as ""the world's
 leading risk and insurance services firm"", he concludes:
 http://www.marsh.ie
 (compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)

 Also: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring
 EircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against
 Eircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this
 country.  Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out
 (1) Their 'Banana Republic' international price comparison page at
 http://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will
 surely make you mad enough to
 (2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter ""No More
 Favours For You, Mr Eircom Employee"" flyer from
 http://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed
 to be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious
 blue/orange Eircom vans.
 Now if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that
 money we all lost on bloody Eircom shares...

 IMHO'S PICK: JOB....................IMHO HO HO (AND A BOTTLE OF RUM)
 
 ""FATHER CHRISTMAS on a bike - Student - Giving out FREEBIES - Four
 weeks"".  No, not us telegraphing our worst nightmare to our shrink,
 but a job description for a position that apparently pays ""enough"".
 Email tmckeagney@msn.com or hell, cycle into his perfume shop at 128
 The Stephens Green Centre and show him what you can do.
 
 And hey, if you're a crazy maniac, that's great too.  It's about
 time we had an Irish SANTACON - after all, no force on earth can
 stop one hundred Santas, especially if they're drunk:
 http://www.santarchy.com/
 (from the San Francisco Police Report, ""the naughty Santas ... had
 reeked (sic) havoc in the emporium ... in an un-Christmas like
 fashion."")

 Heh.  Disproving the stereotype that all accountants are boring:
 some Dublin 2 company is looking for a ""Parti-time bookkeeper"" at
 http://xsls.com?83

 Our attention-deficient gaze also fell briefly this week onto a box
 ad in a Sunday paper which is seeking private investors for an
 ADVENTURE SPORTS RETAILING business in Dublin.  Now this probably
 just means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our
 imagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in
 biplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.
 Just in case we're right, any ""smart, experienced partner/investor""
 looking for an ""equity stake/board position"" should ""express""
 ""interest"" to neptune@atomic.ie.
 
 You know, it might look like we're giving these people free
 advertising, but by putting their email addresses on the public web,
 we're actually GUARANTEEING them spam...
 
 
                           * * * * * * * * *
 
 
 IMHO'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us To Demonstrate
 
 Friday is BUY NOTHING DAY.  For the sake of your own mental health
 and the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try.  It's
 not that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those
 corporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas
 hole in them.
 
 The official home of BND is of course Adbusters
 (http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of
 Irish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up
 at this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds
 like fun - shame they're moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it's
 not for purpose-defeating reasons (""Friday?  Damn, I'm working the
 late shift at McDonald's... how about Saturday?"").  In addition and
 elsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free
 stuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic
 consumer agitation.  Punk's not dead!  Party for your right to
 fight!  No Logo!  Hare Hare!  And so on.
 
 *
 
 We're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which
 is so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring
 about the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one
 newsletter.
 
 We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness
 of the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets
 starting at ""just E50"" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The
 advertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on ""the most
 beautiful women in the world"" who will grace the Simmonscourt
 Pavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl
 and Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.
 You have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press
 ads to divine that it's the ""new Escada Collection"" (the who now?)
 they're modelling.  And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable
 partnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage
 treatment system that is Ticketmaster.

 IMHO'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and Unaccountable
 
 Given our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous
 publishing agenda, there is only one possible download
 recommendation this week.  It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a
 creation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to
 heady new heights.
 
 Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla
 sits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it
 with a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your
 currently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving
 Word's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-
 out wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone
 unless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look
 like you're working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from
 your Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't
 detect anything that looks like browsing.  To think that someone
 devoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!
 It's a beautiful thing.  Go ghosting at
 http://www.ghostzilla.com.

 IMHO'S PICK: INTERNET^HWS................................ON YER BIKE
 
 Roll up, roll up roll up!  Segue right this way!  Amazon is now
 selling the celebrated SEGWAY (aka Ginger, aka IT) online, the hype
 of the millennium finally made available to lowly consumers.  You're
 only four months and five thousands bucks away from participating in
 the future of transport, the most fundamental and significant
 breakthrough in human evolution since the invention of the leg, the
 ""spirit that can change the world"", etc. etc.

 The perfect expression of our post-modern mania for meta-media

 ""Imagine being able to run a Google-like search on your life,"" says
 one of the prophets of doom behind MyLifeBits, an incredibly Dickian
 personalised self-database being developed by - who else? -
 Microsoft.  By cataloguing every single artifact of your life
 history, storing everything in an online repository, you build a
 searchable index of every conversation, document, movement, event
 and action that you ever generate or perform.  It's a continuous
 real-time alibi recorder.  It's a voluntary submission of every
 second of existence to information overload.  It's a system that can
 show you all the photos you were ever in, tell you exactly how many
 phonecalls you've ever made, or retrieve an mpeg of you going to the
 toilet in March, 1986:
 http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993084
 
 Also: we knew that modern innovation was roaring ahead at a
 blistering pace, but can MyLifeBits really allow ""time-shifting""?

 We Irish are sometimes so uncultured, compared to our continental
 cousins - even in things you'd expect us to be good at, like
 vandalism.  Here we get inarticulate clowns with cans of red paint
 daubing ""666"" on the gates of Cardinal Connell's palatial Drumcondra
 residence... whereas in Paris, to pick an example out of the blue,
 egghead situationists sneakily attach absurdist plaques (e.g. ""On
 April 17, 1967, nothing happened here"") onto public buildings:

 Microsoft have co-opted the AmIHotOrNot concept, as is their wont, mixed

 LEGACY MEDIA.................There Was Nothing In The Air That Night
 
 IRISH TV: If you rush straight home from work after reading this on
 Thursday, you might catch the second semi-final of corny but
 challenging elimination quiz IT'S NOT THE ANSWER (RTE1, 17:30).
 Come on the beardy guy!  The final's on at the same time tomorrow.
 Calm down from all that excitement with the laughable one-hour FAIR
 CITY murder trial special (RTE1, 20:00) - it's quite brilliant how
 the risible scripts really bring out the absolute worst in truly
 terrible actors.  Settle down with a few G&Ts to watch PRIME TIME on
 the same channel at 21:30, where they're discussing Ireland's
 alcoholic epidemic and its attendant social problems, or waste them
 on either the bottom-scraping POLICE ACADEMY 3 (N2, 21:30) or the
 geriatric 1978 blockbuster COMA (TG4, 22:05).
 
 Friday night, and after a hard day of buying nothing you can flop in
 front of creepy Hitler doco SIX MOST EVIL MEN (N2, 21:00).  Near as
 we can tell, the other evil men are Macauley Culkin in UNCLE BUCK
 (TV3, 20:00), gossip columnist WINCHELL in a solid eponymous biopic
 (N2, 21:30), the big boss bad guy - is it Kang? Kane? Cowen? - in
 MORTAL KOMBAT (TG4, 21:25), Mel Gibson in predictable 80s drug
 thriller TEQUILA SUNRISE (RTE1, 23:50), and Quentin Tarantino
 jumping on his own bandwagon in DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO (TV3,
 0:50).  Hang on, Dave Fanning might be one of the evil men too: he's
 presenting THE LAST BROADCAST on Network 2 at 23:35.

   | 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list
 
 That (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
 too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).
 
 Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
 it works fine.
 
   | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
   |    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
   |    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
   |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.
 
 This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
 the mouse.
 
 Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
 be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
 shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
 key bindings.
 
 But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
 the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
 to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
 (and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
 link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".
 
 Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
 time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
 implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
 achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
 be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).
 
   | How's spring shaping up ""down under""?
 
 No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told
 that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better
 during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.    In any case,
 all of that is a good enough reason to stay away...

    attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
    editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,

    Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
    FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
    downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
    full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
    you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
    without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
    program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
    interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
    book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves
    awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:

    One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
    organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
    keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
    refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
    windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
    week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
    your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
    and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
    handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
    interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
    organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:

 2.4?
 
 2.5 has been out for over a year.
 
 I can't think of anything with those symptoms in 2.4, but why don't you try 
 the upgrade and see if you still have the problem.

 That won't work like you want.  You'll end up with a boot loader
 on the backup disk that contains the 'physical' location of
 the /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won't necessarily
 be the same as the backup disk.
 
 I can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got
 a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk
 every night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to
 get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.
 
 GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it
 doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help
 for you though...
 
 Later,
 Kenn

798,"more accurately: someone's dream changes reality for everyone, and
 everyone's memory adjusts to perceive the new realities as a continuum,
 replete with new pasts and new memories.
 
 ever have dreams that ""create"" their own history to make their irrealities
 plausible and authentic feeling?
 
 ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all day?
 i'm sure it's some neurochemical process initiated during the dream that is
 still cycling thru - like a deja vu, triggered by memory processes, where
 you don't actually remember but you feel like you're remembering.

799,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at
 part of the equation.
 
 America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is
 a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There
 is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the
 right time, to go that high.
 
 Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is
 involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.
 Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.
 Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.
 
 Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the
 rest of us who tend to sort.
 
 There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the
 first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree
 at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits
 of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.
 
 And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity
 of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most
 people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better
 if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the
 Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'
 is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.
 
 Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far
 more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.
 Superior performance, often not.

 After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
 fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
 science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
 science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
 what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction: 
 
     Squid on the Mantelpiece 
 
     Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
     first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
     element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
     emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
     that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
     properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
     a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
     conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
     thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece."" 
 
     Card Tricks in the Dark 
 
     Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
     joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
     relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
     very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. 
     (Attr. Tim Powers) 
 
 I had the cold from hell all weekend and I'm jetlagged, but I wanted to get 
 some links up before I hit the sack. Until tomorrow! Link[1] Discuss[2]

 John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
 [1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
 gold rush. 
 
 Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
 advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
 product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
 consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. 
 
 There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
 rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
 immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
 to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
 And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
 of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

 Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
 shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say
 
 WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
 charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
 government-issued credit cards?
 
 (a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.
 
 (b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.
 
 (c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
 membership.
 
 (d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
 rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.
 
 (e) all of the above.
 
 ""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
 Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
 government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
 the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""
 
 The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
 audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
 unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
 2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
 credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
 carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
 billion in goods and services, the audit found.
 
 In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
 government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
 then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
 supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
 travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.
 
 ""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
 strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
 suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
 take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
 reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
 worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
 imagine.""
 
 Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
 cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
 armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
  
 Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
 noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
 be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
 such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. 
 
 Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
 documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
 so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
   
 ""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
 Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
 taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
  
 ""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
 against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
 force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
 instead of offending the taxpayer.""

 I'm afraid it didn't help. It still seems to be slower than ~1 month

 Well that exploit requires an executable stack so it won't happen on a

 <font size=3><b>Battered stocks regain ground</b></font><br>
 Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose Thursday.
 <p>
 Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to ""reduce/sell"", the Internet portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11 percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.
 <p>
 Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.0 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 8,801.5. The S&P 500 added 6.9 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 927.37, after it too reached a five-year low Wednesday.

 Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs.
 For retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate or promotional programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.<br><B>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13% </B>

 The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
 The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.<br><B>EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% </B>

 Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.
 
 The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.<br><B>SAP AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT ADS 19.70 -7.73% </B>

 Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.<br><B>YAHOO INC 12.92 5.99% </B><br>

 Senate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill
 By Roy Mark
 
 The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to
 promote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron
 Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act
 would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is
 co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).
 
 The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would
 support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective
 education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers
 and professionals.
 
 ""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step
 forward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to
 full Senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""Nowhere in the world
 are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of
 nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to
 lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide
 the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate
 new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will
 ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.""
 
 The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology
 program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also
 create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National
 Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and
 technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.
 
 ""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to
 change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer
 revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will
 mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing the
 bill. ""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a
 half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various
 nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader
 in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to
 achieving that goal.
 
 To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for
 Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to
 Nanotechnology would also be established.
 
 According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the
 National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the
 National Nanotechnology Initiative in June.
 
 Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;
 emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and
 short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,
 equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research
 that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting
 interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology
 transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal
 implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,
 educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for
 measuring progress toward program goals.

 * Come work on Thinking in Java in Crested Butte
 * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent
 * Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 6 Available
 * Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar, Bay Area, November
 * Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar, Bay Area, November
 * New seminars
 * Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for sale
 
 See the Calendar for the current schedule:
 http://www.mindview.net/Calendar
 
 ===================================
 * Come work on Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, in Crested Butte
 
 All but one of the Interns has departed (he's staying through
 December) and we have empty rooms in the condo that I rented in Mt.
 Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to
 volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late
 Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay
 in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java,
 please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
 availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
 October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
 interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
 others.
 
 This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.
 
 ===================================
 * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent
 
 The second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
 http://64.78.49.204/
 
 The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
 multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
 goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
 threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
 simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).
 
 The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
 final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
 yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.
 
 Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
 beginning of the book.
 
 The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
 appear in December.
 
 ===================================
 * Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow
 
 Available at:
 http://64.78.49.204/
 
 Chapters 1-4 are finished
 
 ===================================
 * Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar
 November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
 Registration opens on September 4th.
 http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/ThinkingInJava/
 
 Created by Bruce Eckel, taught by Andrea Provaglio. We believe this
 is the best in-depth introduction to Java that you'll find.  It's
 based on the book ""Thinking in Java,"" which was created as the
 seminar evolved.
 
 Please note the early registration discount: 
 * $1,600 for payments received by October 12th
 * $1,950 for payments received after October 12th
 
 ===================================
 * Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar
 November 18th-22th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
 Registration opens on September 4th.
 http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/J2EE/
 
 Created and taught by Andrea Provaglio, this seminar introduces you
 to the practical development of real-world, Web-enabled,
 distributed applications with Java. It covers J2EE and its key
 technologies: Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java ServerPages, and
 the basic architectural patterns used to combine these technologies
 into maintainable applications. 
 
 Andrea has been teaching this course in the US and in Europe for
 the last two years, and he has recently restructured and updated
 the seminar to include the latest J2EE features.
 
 You'll come out of this course with a comprehensive understanding
 of the J2EE architecture, of the problems that it is designed to
 solve, how to select the most appropriate tools, and how to code
 your solutions.
 
 Please note the early registration discount: 
 * $1,700 for payments received by October 26th
 * $2,300 for payments received after October 26th
 
 ===================================
 * New seminars
 
 Bill Venners and I just finished giving the last ""Objects &
 Patterns"" seminar, and everyone (especially us) had a great time.
 
 We are now beginning to work towards the two new seminars spawned
 by Objects & Patterns, which Bill and I plan to teach together:
 Design Patterns in Java
 (Drawing primarily from ""Thinking in Patterns"")
 
 Designing Objects & Systems
 This will include a lot of material from Bill's upcoming book on
 Object Design, along with coverage of UML, XP, Object-Oriented
 Design techniques and guidelines, and of course exercises and
 projects.
 
 We hope to begin teaching the courses early next year. Stay tuned.
 
 ===================================
 * Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for sale
 
 I'm selling the last 17 of my author copies of Thinking in Java,
 2nd edition. I've signed each one and drawn a little cartoon with
 the signature (the books are in La Mesa, and I'm in Crested Butte,
 so unfortunately I can't personalize them). The cost in the USA is
 $40, which includes handling and mailing. Outside the USA, you'll
 have to email to the address below to find out the additional
 shipping cost.
 
 To order, divide your credit card number (Visa, MC, Amex) into two
 different emails (not high security, but highly likely to be safe),
 and include your credit card billing address and expiration date.
 Email your order to:
 Wayne@MindView.net
 Wayne will email you back to clarify any necessary details.

 Please sign-up at the Linux Counter:
 
 Please visit it and sign up (if you haven't already) at 
 http://counter.li.org/
 
 Why?
 
 * It's a small way of saying 'thank you' to an excellent OS and
   acknowledging you find it useful... 
 * Letting everyone out there know where all GNU/Linux is being used
 * Building a useful database of GNU/Linux in your locality (Goa)
 * Finding out where all other people in Goa are using GNU/Linux.
 * Just seeing how this volunteer driven model builds itself by
   innovative styles of organising....

 GNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX
 
 >From Frederick Noronha
 
 INDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
 prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
 Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
 immense promise it holds out to the Third World.
 
 But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? 
 
 >From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
 catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
 towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
 office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
 earnings.
 
 United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
 <radhika.lal@undp.org>, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
 Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
 E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.
 
 infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
 University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
 draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
 both the public and private sector.
 
 This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
 about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
 importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
 users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
 e-Government and related fields.
 
 Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
 Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.
 
 ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
 for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
 But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
 so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.
 
 See http://www.egovos.org/
 
 OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
 ======================
 
 Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
 showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
 tools. 
 
 Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
 Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. 
 
 It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.
 
 UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin <jc.dauphin@unesco.org> of the Information
 Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
 been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
 movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
 and culture.
 
 It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
 the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising,
 updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for
 including new basic documents. 
 
 ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can
 be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,""
 said Dauphin. 
 
 Check out the sites at
 
 UNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/)
 UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/)
 UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/)
 UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)
 
 NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
 ======================
 
 Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
 from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
 IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
 to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. 
 
 CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
 freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
 the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
 (GPL license). 
 
 See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml
 
 Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
 based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
 about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
 related issues.
 
 ""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid
 Akhtar told this correspondent.
 
 Niranjan Rajani <niranjan.rajani@maailma.net>, of Pakistani origin but based
 in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
 ""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".
 
 This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
 undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
 Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.
 
 This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
 of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
 GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
 countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
 and lives of these countries.
 
 CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
 ======================
 
 In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
 presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. 
 
 Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
 the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
 computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
 speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.
 
 Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
 attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
 giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
 lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.
 
 Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
 Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
 making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
 varsities, military installations and within government. 
 
 Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
 Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
 of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
 supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
 government sector.
 
 On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
 Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
 news.
 
 GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
 out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)
 
 ""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare
 Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
 to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater
 <dirk@welfarelaw.org>. 
 
 While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
 another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
 remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. 
 
 Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
 in low-income communities, access is still an issue. 
 
 Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
 sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
 access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
 homes. 
 
 LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
 for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
 face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.
 
 ""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
 works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
 discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<
 according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income
 Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.
 
 LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems
 that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving
 a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed
 like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar
 projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. 
 
 LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using
 donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led
 organizations that LINC serves. 
 
 ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use
 open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to
 document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide
 details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC
 explains.
 
 LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and
 installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in
 people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone
 computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.
 
 Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local
 support.
 
 ""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely
 successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether
 the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more
 effectively,"" said Slater.
 
 To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC
 Project Linux pages at <http://www.lincproject.org/toolkit/linux>
 
 NEED TO NETWORK
 ===============
 
 Bala Pillai <bala@tamil.net>, who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
 Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
 organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
 impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.
 
 Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
 zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
 psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. 
 
 ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
 time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
 Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
 more symbiosis with them,"" says he. 
 
 Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
 with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
 ""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
 Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. 
 
 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
 another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look
 for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. 
 
 ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
 likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
 publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
 found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
 work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.

 Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
 Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT
 
 Dear friends,
 
 Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
 Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
 support their cash-strapped initiatives? 
 
 Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
 of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.
 
 Jeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently. It could
 surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
 make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. 
 
 It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
 workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
 initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
 such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
 greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
 ours. --FN

 Last time I tried this (see tokenizer.py comments), the f-n rate after
 stripping tags ranged from 0.982% to 1.781%, with a median of about 1.34%,
 so we've made tons of progress on the f-n rate since then.  But the mere
 presence of HTML tags still remains a significant clue for c.l.py traffic,
 so I'm left with the same comment:
 
 > # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
 > # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.
 
 If we want to take the focus of this away from c.l.py traffic, I can't say
 what effect HTML stripping would have (I don't have suitable test data to
 measure that on).

 KFJC has a MP3 stream at kfjc.org. I'd also recommend radioparadise.com.

 Why is it that I envision Verisign doing something like this.  Yeah,

   | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,
 
 Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...
 
     # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
     foreach m $rseq {
         if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
             Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
             set ix [lsearch $seq $m]
             set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]
         } else {
             # Real hack
             break
         }
     }
 
 which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
 of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
 first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
 of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
 and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
 sequences it is looking at, all the time...
 
 It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
 folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
 directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...
 
 Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
 context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.
 
   | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less

 I recently brought up a new system - SuSe 7.3 and I am running
 spamassassin and procmail, which work fine.
 
 I tried bringing up razor (2.14) but I am not able to get the SDK to
 install and razor reports missing modules. They appear to be there. I
 followed the installation directions. There appears to be an endless list
 of errors. Any ideas on what to do or where to start?

 The total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5
 messages.

 I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
 difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
 The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.
 
 Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
 words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
 That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
 classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
 new.
 
 So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
 and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
 headers that my mail reader added:
 
 class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):
 
     skip = {'received': 1,
             'date': 1,
             'x-from_': 1,
             }
 
     def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
         for k, v in msg.items():
             k = k.lower()
             if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                 continue
             for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                 for t in tokenize_word(w):
                     yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)
 
 This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
 tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
 run that used the timtest header tokenizer.
 
 It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
 discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
 Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
 that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
 indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
 Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
 spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
 XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).
 
 One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
 people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
 start with stuff like:
 
 > Dear Sir/Madam,
 > 
 > May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
 > solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science student
 
 I guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.

 I've seen data that shows 1200 rocks (TV-set sized and smaller)
 crashing into the Ottawa skies /every/ /single/ /night/, and that's
 just the background noise.  Plots of that data show us passing through
 hundreds of 'tubes' of debris, each indicative of some other larger
 something out there, only a small handful of which have been
 discovered.  This is without even considering the one's headed this
 way out of the Oort for their First Big Trip.
 
 One thing you will just have to get used to is hearing news of a
 possible collision; we have only started funding the projects to look
 for these things since Hollywood took an interest with Armageddon, and
 we have only just recently turned on a bunch of new toys to do
 automated sky surveys.  There are also some new (and very clever)
 amateur projects co-ordinating multiple telescopes to detect these
 criters, one of which plans to network dozens of ground based machines
 around the world.  You may remember a few years back the 2028 doomsday
 story -- consider them good ghost stories, then go back to work.
 
 20,000 years ago, one of them the size of Mt Everest just ever so
 slightly grazed us and left a scar 400km long in the side of South
 America before it scooted out into space.  First nations people would
 have been there then, and it would have seriously ruined their day.
 Orbital elements tell us that our modern technology would have perhaps
 given us 90-min advance warning.   
 
 The near-miss earlier this month wasn't seen until it was already past
 us; we can't detect rocks on their trip behind the Sun, and when they
 come out slingshot to relativistic speeds, well, it's just too darn
 late to do much of anything about it.  On the inbound trip, even at
 their max full-moon angle, these things are most often magnitude 16 or
 way worse, which is many magnitudes fainter than what you see in the
 deepest dark-skies; no one thought to paint them shiny and white.
 They day before it ""hits"" my software says NT7 will be magnitude 14 --
 it's easier to see the space station.
 
 What's worse, the Sun is not a smooth hard spheric marble, it's a
 twisted gelatinous hunk o' hunk o' burnin' love, so the precise warp
 curve of space right near it's backside is (ahem) somewhat problematic
 to compute precisely.  It's also spewing considerable plasma flux in
 all directions, and then there's all these other big gelatinous roaming
 globs (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune) and some significant roaming
 rubble (us), and damn it, they are all spinning too, and most of them
 have a magnetosphere!
 
 Shit. Forget it.
 
 Learn to play the banjo. Take peppermint Rye-Kee Shee-At-Zoo relaxation
 therapy and oodles of Ag-nasial I&I-drop suppliments, eat no kind of
 frozen portion, and floss.  Good planets are real hard to find, so
 enjoy the one you got while it's here.  Call your ma. Do an anonymous
 kindness for your better half, another for a total stranger. Having
 all the best toys is useless when they all spontaneously combust from
 a global Wormwood shockwave. You should be diggin' it while it's
 happenin'
 
 Like, just live your life like there's no tomorrow, ok?  Don't bank on
 being able to redeem yourself later. Yeah, sure, Osama could whack you
 with some nail-coated fuel-air bombs, heck a mis-informed TopGun could
 do it too, but the Good Lord could do it too, with pure, clean and
 galactically EnviroFriendly kinetic energy, and He don't stand in line
 for no Airport Security Check. Hell, fire and brimstone are
 classically given in the reverse order; best to be on the impact side
 of the planet.
 
 Learn to stop worrying and love the Rock.  Besides, the rats and
 cockroaches will survive, and they already know how to kickstart
 evolution right back into Enrons, WorldComs and Calcuttas.  They even
 have all our wiring and plumbing diagrams and half of our socks.
 
 Are we going to get hit?  Yup.  
 
 When?  Every 65 million years and, oh my lord, will you /look/ at the time!
 
 Where/what/when? Space is pretty big.  Take the largest thing you can
 imagine, double it, and add 10%: That is just the local pancake region
 between us and the Sun. There's the whole rest of the disk of the
 ecliptic and, which is where the NT7 observation came from, it has
 only recently occurred to the meteor hunters to ""look up"" (or down);
 almost the first shot looking /out/ of the ecliptic disk, and hoo-whee
 there's this big sucker on an ""11 tries for a dollar"" close encounter
 of the smack-em-good kind.
 
 This is what I love about astrophysics: we have theories as good as
 anyone else (way better than psychology), and we debate and argue and
 expound and conference and bellow and blurt about them, but every time
 we turn on some new kind of robot sensor device to actually /look/ at
 Reality, well she slaps us right in the face and says in her best Mae
 West ""Guess again, boys"" -- no other science gets that chance (ok,
 maybe some do) and there is nothing, _nothing_ more worthless than last
 semester's astronomy text.

 I've got these huge fish [12inchers currently but still growing].
 
 I know someone else with them too alonmg with a couple of cats, anyway one
 day the cats sat on top of the tank waiting for the fish to do a swim-by and
 they readied their paws for the kill. Trouble is the fish were also
 interested in a feed and they were significantly faster than the cats. [They
 could'nt actually hurt them as they only eat fish/very small rodents] in the

 its mostly mice though. and they will eventually (after a few summers)
 stop bringing their kills back to the house, once they realise that
 you're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt.
 
 (they're trying to teach you hunting basically. they do the same with
 kittens - first bring back kills, and then later they bring back live
 but injured prey for the kittens to practice on).
 
 although they'll still bring back stuff on occassion.

 Sender: nettime-l-request@bbs.thing.net
 Reply-To: Phil Duncan <PDuncan@AggregateStudio.com>
 
 The following prayer is from a story by Mark Twain, and was quoted by Lewis
 Laphan in the October issue of Harper's magazine. It occurs at the very end
 of an excellent article which I recommend to you.
 
 In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been
 listening to an heroic sermon about ""the glory to be won in battle by young
 patriots armed with the love of God."" He usurps the pulpit and prays the
 following:
 
 ""O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our
 shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their
 patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of
 their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with
 a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows
 with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little
 children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and
 hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of
 winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of
 the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their
 hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their
 steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood
 of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the
 Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that
 are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.""
 
 Twain wrote the story, ""The War Prayer,"" in 1905 during the American
 occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923,
 thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it ""unsuitable""
 for publication at the time it was written.

  	  An island getaway
 An island in Tracadie harbour is about to become the Nova Scotia getaway
 for movie stars Ethan Hawke
 <http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1010.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48>
 and Uma Thurman
 <http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1347.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48>
 and their two children. Owner Marie Kelly confirmed she is finalizing
 the sale of her 3.6-hectare island, which comes complete with two
 cottages and road access across a 60-metre land bridge. She didn't
 divulge the price. The couple, whom she met through a mutual friend in
 the area, had discussed buying the island four years ago. But she didn't
 make the decision to sell until January when her family was no longer
 interested in keeping their summer home, purchased in the late 1960s.
 Hawke, an Oscar nominee for his role in Training Day in 2001, visited
 the Tracadie area in June. He is now on tour to promote his second book,
 Ash Wednesday. His first novel, Hottest State, was published in 1996.
 Thurman is known for her 1994 lead roles in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
 and Pulp Fiction, for which she received an Oscar nomination.=20

 British boys reserved?
 Gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow
 <http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1833.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
 currently single and searching for love, has complained that British men
 just don't play the dating game the way she's used to. The 29-year-old
 actress, who has a home in London and was there to perform on stage in
 Proof, says: ""British people don't seem to ask each other out on dates.
 If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in
 America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should
 be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake."" Gwyneth,
 previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt
 <http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1389.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48>
 and Ben Affleck
 <http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1411.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
 admits she was asked out a couple of times when last in London, and she
 accepted with pleasure. One of her ""very charming"" dates was actor James
 Purefoy
 <http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/4090.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
 who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to
 really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town
 is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town.

 A one-on-one interview
 Muscle-bound Vin Diesel
 <http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1206.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
 star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters. In fact,
 he was so taken by Entertainment Tonight reporter, Maria Manounos, that
 he asked her out! Menounos, 24, is a former Massachusetts Teen USA
 winner. She got the chance to interview the 35-year-old Diesel in July
 and when the subject of dating came up, she asked if he was ""available"".
 It turns out he was and a week later the pair ran into each other again
 at the premiere of XXX in Westwood, California. When he saw Maria,
 according to a tabloid news report, he grabbed her hand and started
 whispering in her ear. He was overhead promising to see her later in the
 day.

 I am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.
 I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).
 Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

 ""Chastity"" technologies were doomed from the start, and I'll add chemical

 Generally,someone is attempting to preserve a relationship with this

 preserving it is of little value.  Hardware is of no real use save for 
 playing the power-struggle game.   I don't want to see the future of this.

 This ""more sophisticated than [Napster or Freenet]"" part seems
 to be the same behavior implemented in many other P2P CDNs, 
 such as:
 
   - Kazaa
   - EDonkey/Overnet
   - BitTorrent

 Is that message hiding in your log?  Perhaps there should be a return from

 I love this business.  If a bridge falls over, the architect or the

 Ours is the /only/ industry that can hold itself 100% un-responsible

 You just gotta love a mass-delusion like that.
 
 Although it's like a total shock to 99.999% (5nines) of all the
 employed website designers out there, the truth is webforms /can/
 accept ""U.S. of A"" as a country.  Incredible, but true.  Web forms can
 also accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can
 even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done
 without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's
 Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor
 locking your business into their ""small transaction fee"" tithe.
 
 Of course, try and tell one of those 5-niners that and they'll get all
 defensive, black list you as a sh*t disturber and undermine your
 reputation with the boss...  not that I'm speaking first-hand or
 anything ;)

 Another theory is that Europe was a rural backyard until the Renaissance,
 certainly when compared to big urban centres like Constantinople and Baghdad.
 
 I don't know the genetic studies of which you speak, but I know of one that
 is sort-of relevant: apparently men of Ashkenazi descent are susceptible
 to sickle-cell anemia and the probable reason is that the same genetic
 factor that causes that also protects women from tuberculosis (IIRC), which
 would have come in handy in central European towns at a time when the Jewish
 population was a lot more urbanised than average Joes.

 I noticed that after upgrading to 2.41 (or 2.50) from 2.31, the -F
 option was removed from spamd. 
 
 This is fine because all of the HTML format mail seems to arrive
 properly. However, messages that get tagged as Spam arrive as just html
 source.
 
 Is there any way around this? I would like all HTML/RTF messages to
 retain their formatting even if they are flagged as spam. I would
 accomplish this on 2.31 by using the ""-F 0"" flag when starting spamd.
 
 Thanks!

 Not a bad idea at all, provided we avoid Texas's mistake.  If we get 
 two senators for each of Scotland, Norn Iron, Wales and England, plus 
 our fair share of congressthings, we end up with the biggest voting 
 block in the US legislature and for the presidency, with a political 
 spectrum whose extreme right can't poke the extreme left of the 
 current US one with a long, long stick.  One sudden lurch to the left 
 by the US political establishment later, we own the place.
 
 Byzantium, anyone?

 How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
 through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
 and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.
 
 ... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
 as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
 robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
 I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
 discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
 machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
 and therefore empty 'thx'.
 
 AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
 line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
 /also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
 use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
 clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
 stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.
 
 Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
 it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
 ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)
 
 In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
 other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
 simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
 talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
 terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  
 
 People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
 clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
 user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
 clunky interface.
 
 Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle
 weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather
 icon sitting there on your desktop?
 
 Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,
 ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:

 I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
 since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.
 
 An easy thing is to start the same way:  move all the files into a single
 directory.  Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
 Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
 N other directories accordingly.

850,"Hi all,
 
 I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
 that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
 testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
 people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
 that, right? ;-)
 
 I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
 should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
 maybe others, who knows ;-)
 
 Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
 - Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
 - Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
 - Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
 - Install the ""alsa-utils"" package
 
 Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
 /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
 http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
 (very complete and very good documentation!)
 Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)
 
 Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
 to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
 insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
 check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
 e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.
 
 With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
 can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
 hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
 files... that's it!
 
 It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
 thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
 imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
 /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
 %post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
 structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
 default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
 development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
 libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
 which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
 rpm release, so does the architecture!).
 
 I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!
 
 Download :
 http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/
 
 Current spec files :
 http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
 http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
 http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
 (All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )
 
 Matthias
 
 PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
 run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

 Socialism increases regulation which increases corruption.  But that
 doesn't matter as much as if the official law does not conform to the
 facts on the ground.
 
 If you don't match the law to the facts on the ground, you wind up with
 a two-tier society (De Soto's Bell Jar).  Worse, the massive evasion of
 the official law encourages the corruption you speak of.
 
 In some countries, the agencies in charge of registering property also
 arrange for illegal living arrangements for their employees.  They do
 this because even the people who run the system can't make it work for
 people they care about.

 Possible - should be, it was possible to update to (null) from RH7.3 with

 I decided to upgrade the kernel on a machine at home from 2.2.18pre21 to the latest from kernel.org which is 2.4.19.
 
 However I have encountered one problem, my network card now dosent work, well kind of dosent work...
 
 Instead of one eth0 on IRQ 10 I now get:
 Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x220, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a 3e 0e 48, IRQ 5.

 This results in the interface(s) coming up but while packets can go out they can not come in.
 
 I've tried not loading the 3c509 mdule on bootup and then `modload 3c509 IRQ=10` bit it still gets loaded as above, on IRQ 5 and 10. On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.
 
 Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific. Have I missed some kernel setting?

 Bob,
 
 This guy's an idiot.
 
 I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864
 of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules
 each.  They weigh 125 kg.
 
 You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked
 maximizes that.
 
 It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking
 and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need
 voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual
 capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them
 arranged in series to boost the voltage.
 
 Ignore him.  He's a waste of my time.

 Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like
 1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible
 to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for
 accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.
 (the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)
 
 Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few
 real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were
 talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the
 wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,
 it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady
 discharge curve.
 
 But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not
 the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those
 you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole
 atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with
 a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,
 and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.

 ------- Additional Comments From easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu  2002-09-21 16:41 -------
 I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
 on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since
 the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
 crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
 between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
 especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
 suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
 what's needed are one or more of the below:
         A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
            with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow
            for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a
            mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
            once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
            in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
            ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel;
         B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
            well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
            fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or
            better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
            parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
            as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
            parameters.

 If we had more variety of franchise food than the
 Wendys/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell/TimHorton's monopoly (they are all Pepsi
 under the hood, aren't they?), things might be different.  When a New

  I felt like that till recently, but now wish that it wasn't rammed down

 If there's any sanity in the world, even the original poster would be glad
 to have his kneejerk response blocked <wink>.  OTOH, you know there are a
 great many msgs on c.l.py (all over Usenet) that do nothing except quote a
 previous post and add a one-line comment.  Remove the quoted sections from
 those, and there may be no content left to judge except for the headers.  So
 I can see this nudging the stats in either direction.  The only way to find

 <font size=3><b>Techs fall with consumer sentiment</b></font><br>
 A drop in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index helped put a dent in technology shares Friday.
 <p>
 Despite Dell Computer raising its outlook and better-than-expected earnings from Juniper Networks, CNET's Tech index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.51 percent, to 990.0. The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49.
 <p>
 Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session. The S&P 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 921.39.

 I use a virtual window manager and keep the main exmh window and 
 the detached folder list on one virtual desktop but the unseen 
 window is set to show on all desktops.
 
 Got no help for the problems, but just pointing out why some of 
 us find the unseen window invaluable.

 Should be fixed : You probably had libdv-devel installed and MPlayer
 automatically detected it. The new spec file explicitely passes
 --disable-libdv when the package is rebuilt with --without libdv.
 
 Grab the ""fr2.1"" spec from here :

 Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
 losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
 Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
 more machines for the Japanese market. 
 
 They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 
 
  
 VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
  
 Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
 quality than its VHS rival. 
 
 Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
 1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
 film rental industry and in homes. 
 
 Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 
 
 ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
 market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
 secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 
 
 Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
 format. 
 
 The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
 television and film industries and will be unaffected. 
 
 But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
 for Betamax home players. 
 
 In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 
 
 Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
 competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 
 
 The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
 although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 
 
 A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
 new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 
 
 Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

 Nice trick.
 
 One thing - to save an image as an animated GIF (for example),
 you just do a save as, and set the extension to .gif - you should
 get a dialog asking whether you want to merge visible layers or
 save as an animation. I believe that you can also specify the
 extension as .mpg or .mpeg if you've got the mpeg plug-in built.
 
 Cheers,
 Dave.

 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.
 
 I should have finished this off.
 
 3) Keep hitting space to loop thru all the folders that match 
    the characters you typed.  Hit return to actually select the
    folder shown in the message area.
 
 I don't use this for navigating into nested folders as the only 
 thing I have nested is my archives.  Someone else will have to 
 tell you how to do that if there are any tricks to it.

 Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
 last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
 downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
 also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
 triggers.

 IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single
 developer license downloadable from their website.

 It was a crushing blow to discover that <a 
 href=""http://www.cnet.com/software/0-3227852-1204-9931175.html"">Vindigo</a>, my
 all-time-favorite Palm app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks
 wasn't steep, but the principle of paying for a former freebie
 was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though; surprising
 myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd
 rather dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.

 That's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that
 most of us have gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail
 accounts, most ""free"" Web e-mailers have started charging for
 premium services or imposing strict limitations on free accounts.
 Read our <a 
 href=""http://home.cnet.com/software/0-3227888-8-20089773-1.html"">reviews</a> 
 of the four top services to see what you get if
 you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you want
 to stay spam-free.

 Surfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app.
 The latest version of the popular file-sharing software BearShare
 now offers a paid version that lets you search and download
 without those annoying ads. Maybe the best things in life are now
 those with a fee.

 I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other
    tech trends are overshadowed by this scandal. Now entering its
    fourth week as front-page news, WorldCom woes continue to sap

    the company are standing silent against government accusations
    of wrongdoing.

 This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer

    downloading music. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's
    tests, it had an abysmal success rate at actually returning

  Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected

  (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
  
  
  Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
  traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
  people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
  
  
  Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
  Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
  nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
  contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
  
  Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
  part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
  off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
  
  Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
  did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
  
  As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
  mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
  
  Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
  was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
  
  Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
  yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
  from video footage.
  
  Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
  contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
  that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
  
  The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
  the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
  through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
  But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
  
  The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
  undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
  minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
  grab their reins.
  
  The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
  boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
  Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
  
  The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
  of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
  the Assumption of the Virgin.

 Classic X copy-and-paste behavior is that you can only paste what is
 currently highlighted.  In fact, it is the act of highlighting a
 selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.  X has
 no ""copy"" command -- if you highlighted it, you just copied it.

 If ab application has a ""copy"" command that you can choose to use
 separately from the process of highlighting something, that command
 is something the application authors wrote on their own.  (And it it
 likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
 also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
 work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
 functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
 functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
 are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

  This is a pain. 
 
  The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
 original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:
 
  rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*
 
  RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
 and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
 installed is beyond me.

 Lennon killer seeks parole again
 
 The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
 early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
 62nd birthday.
 Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
 superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
 It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
 Attica state prison.
 At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
 had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
 ex-Beatle.
 Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
 Shot dead
 Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
 York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
 He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
 during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
 Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
 Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
 Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
 The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
 before the shooting.
 'Deserved death'
 Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
 crime.
 Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
 Chapman were released.
 Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
 Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
 commercial success.
 The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
 have been 62 on Wednesday.

 openssh-3.0.2p1-1
 
 I think that is directly from openssh site. It's from the RH 6.2 that I 
 upgraded to 7.2 (6.2 doesn't ship with openssh...). 
 
 I probably should downgrade to the versoin RH provides except I can't do

 Cool, one less package to maintain :)
 
 One interesting thing about alsaplayer is that RedHat's XMMS package in RH8 will
 probably not play mp3 files. But alsaplayer does play mp3s ""out of the box"".
 
 Also, they are developing rapidly in their CVS and looks like their next version
 of alsaplaer will be pretty cool, but I have no idea when it will be ready.

 This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware

 approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
 values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
 not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
 more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

 >It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, 
 >precisely identical between males and females.
 
 Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
 But that obscures the different modes of
 promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
 money or power or companionship and the person
 who uses money and power and companionship to
 get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
 of the word. But their motives and behavior are
 quite different.
 
 Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
 article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
 are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
 .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
 cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
 the best strategy for female langurs, because
 ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
 extra-group males as possible, female langurs
 ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
 by the male who is likely next to rule the
 roost.
 
 Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
 picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
 promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
 is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
 better picture of that. ;-)

 Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem. 
 
 I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They both
 display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home
 box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
 I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
 carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.
 
 That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
 place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
 exmh working on the same set of folders.
 
 It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
 so bad that I can't stand it.

 That depends on how the list is collected, or
 even on what the senders say about how the list
 is collected. Better to just put it on a website,
 and that way it can be surfed anonymously. AND
 it doesn't clutter my inbox.

 btw, it does have that gconf editor included.
 
 I dumped the RPMS from the Limbo cd's 1 to 3 onto a drive, ran a few scripts, edited
 sources.list (rpm file:///path-to-files/RPMS.os os [I think]) and used ""apt-get

 No, not at all.  I was only concerned where the border between religion 
 and cult gets real fuzzy, and where the r/c in question has known
 paranoiac tendencies.  
 
 Then again, maybe you're right, it's a very close match in job
 descriptions.  Obviously it does not concern anyone else, and since
 it's none of my business, I'll shut up about it and put it down to
 more funky fun in US politics.
 
 Afterall, all I know for certain about the Mormons is the background
 and fallout on my ex-wife's excommunication ;)

  Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
  (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
  
  
  So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
  or sick of Sheffield.
  
  Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
  this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
  heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
  
  Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
  with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
  emigrate to provincial Russia.
  
  After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
  article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
  side.
  
  ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
  deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
  
  ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
  cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
  becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
  
  The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
  tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
  
  It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
  famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
  opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
  
  And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
  ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
  enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
  life.
  
  ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
  of whisky for kopecks.""
  
  There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
  halfpenny in sterling.
  
  The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
  will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
  vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
  diehard alcoholics.
  
  While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
  newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
  soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
  settler should overcome the difficulty.
  
  ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
  off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
  
  One or two potential emigrs might be deterred by language difficulties. There
  are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
  Mongolian border.
  
  However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
  deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
  which they would like to live.
  
  France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
  by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
  
  Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
  weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
  
  Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
  And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
  in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
  that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
  permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
  
  Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
  climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
  solve itself"".
  
  Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
  Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
  
  ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
  million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
  amongst our citizens.""
  
  Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
  surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
  preferred new home.

     >> Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular
     >> email clients""..
 
 The advantage of using a kitchen sink (umm, make that highly programmable)
 editor+email package like Emacs+VM is that you can twiddle your key bindings
 and write a little ELisp (or Pymacs) glue to toss messages in the right
 direction (spam or ham).  For this, spambayes would have to operate in an
 incremental fashion when fed a single ham or spam message.
 
 (No, I have no idea what an ""auto-ham"" is.  A pig run over by a car,
 perhaps?)

   | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
   | color in the ftoc.
 
 That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
 constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
 than others.
 
 In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
 unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
 it doesn't need a different background as well.
 
 I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
 horizontal, and see what turns up.
 
   | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
   | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.
 
 OK.
 
   | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
   | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.
 
 In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
 A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
 displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
 ""all unknown"" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
 no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
 specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
 a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)
 
 
   | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
   | 
   | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.
 
 Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
 relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
 (for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
 bit too similar.   I ended up using
 
 *sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2
 
 The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
 had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
 is probably safer for generic use.

 Senders should vary the recipient list to include non-targets, like party
 officials, and to exclude targets enough to give them plausible
 deniability.

   Content-Type: message/rfc822 mails are handled like attachments
   and are not broken down further into mime parts.  That is, the attachment
   is treated as one part.  The headers and body of the message/rfc822 are
   sent to the server without parsing.  The other way to handle it is to treat it like
   a regular mail, and break it down into parts.
   
   There are reasons to break it down and not to break it down, and right 
   now we chose not to break it down.  This might change in the future.

 I'm not sure which way to make
 the old bits call on this:
 
 [A] <http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-September/014448.html>
 was posted well after
 [B] <http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-August/014351.html>
 was in the archives, but then
 again, [B] didn't bother with
 any commentary (new bits).
 
 If you two can agree upon who
 was at fault, penance will be
 to explain how feedback phase
 is affected by time lags, and
 tie that in to the spontaneous
 generation of ""business cycles""

 Music school jokes --
 
 American conductor and European conductor are talking.  European conductor 
 says ""what a week, I've had 5 rehearsals and a performance.""  ""That's 
 nothing,"" says the American conductor, ""I've had five performances and a 
 rehearsal.""  
 
 What's the difference between a spring in the desert surrounded by palm 
 trees and a violist that plays in tune?  A violist that plays in tune is a 
 mirage.
 
 What's the difference between a rat and a guitar player?  The rat's got 
 something to do tonight.
 
 Good thing it's not comedy school.

 Amazing story about the ""dabba wallahs"" -- India's 112-year-old meal-delivery 
 system that outdoes FedEx using pictograms, bicycles, and largely illiterate 
 (but well-compensated) deliverypeople: 
 
     As part of the tiffin distribution process, every day the meals are picked 
     up from commuters' homes in Mumbai long after the commuters have left for 
     work, delivered to them on time, then picked up and delivered home before 
     the commuters return. 
 
     Each tiffin carrier has, painted on its top, a number of symbols that 
     identify where the carrier was picked up, the originating and destination 
     stations and the address to which it is to be delivered. 
 
     After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest 
     railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination 
     station. 
 
     At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and 
     re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor. 
 
     The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons 
     and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and 
     returned when they came. 
 
     The system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs, and a single tiffin 
     box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to 
     office.

 THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a view
 
 Sometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
 great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
 was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
 family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
 manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
 tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
 posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
 site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
 gravesite!

 DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
 ByScott Tyler Shafer
 August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
 
 DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
 specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
 process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
 hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
 according to company officials.
 
 The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
 family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
 DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
 called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
 data.
 
 According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
 conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
 proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
 businesses.
 
 ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
 ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
 
 Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
 to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
 application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
 alternative.
 
 In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
 importance in the world of XML.
 
 ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
 said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
 Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
 
 Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
 security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
 
 According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
 processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
 itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
 and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
 creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
 
 ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
 adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
 said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
 technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
 will be mostly false.
 Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
 accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
 while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
 and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
 
 The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
 XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
 as they pass through the device.
 
 The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
 balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
 and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
 
 In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
 co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
 control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
 controls the device.
 
 DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
 Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
 May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
 focus on content processing and acceleration.
 The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
 company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
 field trails at a number of other enterprises.
 
 =========================================================================
 
 DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
 founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
 foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
 would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
 grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
 designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
 requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
 interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
 is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
 
 Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
 developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
 and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
 industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
 
 Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
 network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
 Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
 products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
 providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
 industry-leading customers and partners.
 
 DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
 brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
 drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
 Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

 DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding
 
 Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
 in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services
 
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
 leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
 that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
 this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
 Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
 and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of 
 Directors.
 
 DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
 sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
 Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML 
 networkingdevices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
 at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
 and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on 
 its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.
 
 ""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
 intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
 prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
 DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
 XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
 applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
 Technology.
 
 ""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web 
 services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
 DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
 processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
 addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
 protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
 e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
 between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
 
 ""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
 laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
 a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
 Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
 DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
 free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
 performance and security pitfalls.""
 
 ""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
 growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
 security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
 their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
 Generation Three (XG3)technology was quite simply the single most 
 compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
 
 ""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
 about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
 developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
 services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
 XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
 on XML for mission critical applications.""

 My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
 approaching 10 million bytes.  I haven't done anything to try to reduce its
 size, and know of some specific problem areas (for example, doing character
 5-grams of ""long words"" containing high-bit characters generates a lot of
 database entries, and I suspect they're approximately worthless).  OTOH,
 adding in more headers will increase the size.  So let's call it 10 meg
 <wink>.

 Well, first you need to look at the Makefile.PL to see if it uses the
 PREFIX you're trying to pass to it or not. Maybe you'll need to ""override""
 other paths when doing the ""make"".
 Second, the ""%makeinstall"" macro automatically overrides many common values
 like ""prefix="" or ""datadir="", so it's completely redundant with the
 ""PREFIX="" you're passing to it. Take a look at the ""Makefile"" you have at
 that point to see how the ""install"" target is, and what it uses.
 
 Last, as Chris suggested, you can take a look at an existing package, like
 the one in Rawhide ;-)

 It works very nice, would you consider upgrading it to 1.2.6 released only a
 few hours after your build?
 
 Thanks!

 On my box the current system scores about 50 msgs per second (starting in
 memory, of course).  While that can be a drag while waiting for one of my
 full test runs to complete (one of those scores a message more than 120,000
 times, and trains more than 30,000 times), I've got no urge to do any speed
 optimizations -- if I were using this for my own email, I'd never notice the
 drag.  Guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his
 50-msg batches to score, but he's the boss so he bitches about everything
 <wink>.

 I haven't profiled yet, but *suspect* there aren't any egregious hot spots.
 5-gram'ing of long words with high-bit characters is likely overly expensive
 *when* it happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and as an approach to
 non-English languages it sucks anyway (i.e., there's no point speeding
 something that ought to be replaced entirely).

 Since MARCH last year, several attempts have been made to contact Lucio Harper without success and there is no way to contact any of his close relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid.                                                    
                                    
 Since we have access to all Lucio Harper's information,we can claim this money with the help of my partners with the South African Mines and natural resources department.All we have to do is to file claim using you as Lucio Harper's relative.

 You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in 
 receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is 
 erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time 
 mailing, so no removal is necessary.
 
 If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, 
 MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that 
 has ever landed in your Inbox.
 
 MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE
 
 MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit 
 of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, 
 their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally 
 flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.
 
 The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to 
 tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to 
 cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.
 
 HERE'S GOOD NEWS
 
 There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
 abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
 you've dreamed about is easier than you think!
 
 With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you 
 WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to 
 something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of 
 this before.
 
 I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one 
 will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the 
 information. Period.
 
 To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type 
 ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you 
 within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.
 
 Cordially,
 
 Siddhi
 
 P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most 
 eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I 
 honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And 
 it's FREE!

 Hello ~name~,
 
 If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:
 
 http://www.internationalfreecall.com
 
 If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.
 
 Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.
 
 In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.
 
 You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.
 
 Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:
 
 1-410-608-8178# 
 
 Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!
 
 Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.
 
 If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.
 
 In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:
 
 http://www.internationalfreecall.com
 
 In the meantime, the other network on this free calling promotion is OPEX, which is offering 100 minutes of free long distance for trying their program.  
 
 Opex's usual rates are 4.5 cents per minute for domestic calls, with great international rates, too!
 
 For more information on OPEX, or to sign up, please click below:

 How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
 trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.=A0 I know how you feel
 - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise=20
 equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
 either.=A0 It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
 weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.
 
 You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
 miracle diet pill!""=A0 Like you, I was skeptical at first, but=20
 my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks,=20
 so I told her I'd give it a try.=A0 I mean, there was nothing=20
 to lose except a lot of weight!=A0 Let me tell you, it was
 the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
 as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
 to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
 at all.=A0 Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
 
 I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
 and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.=A0I feel
 the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
 does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
 I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
 absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
 
 If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having=20
 any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
 then I recommend the only product that worked for me -=20
 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
 
 You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
 actually work?""
 
 Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which=20
 is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid=20
 weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!!=20
 
 Here is the bottom line ...
 
 I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
 exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.=A0=20
 Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence=20
 to gain!=A0 You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.=A0 This is my
 pledge to you.
 
 BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!=A0=20

 **Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
 ********************************
 
 ""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.
 
 Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)
 
 This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!
 
 We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
  must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
 g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.
 
 Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!
 
 * Mill-stoned & honed.
 * Depressive regressive!
 * Psychologically uplifting!
 * Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
 * Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
 * Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
 * ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
 * 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
 * Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
 * Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
 * Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
 * Easy on, easy off!
 * SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
 * No ""munchie"" factor.
 * No failed drug tests!
 
 Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!
 
 Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.
 
 Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time....

 **PROSAKA (tm)**
 ******************
 
 High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.
 
 This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
 ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.
 
 Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 
 
 Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 
 
 Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.

 **CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm)**
 ***************************
 
 A Sedate Smoking or Brewing Happiness Botanical.
 
 Capillaris Loose-leaf Herba is a very calming, happy sort of smoking/brewing herba. Capillaris Herba is a singular botanical and is best utilized close to bedtime as it is a very sedate herba. Not as potent as Shangrila Zowie Wowie from a smoking perspective (no legal product is), but well worth your attention! Many folks find that if they partake of both smoke and brew that not only do they go to sleep very happily, but that their dreaming life is often nicely enhanced.
 
 Capillaris Herba botanical is best rolled or bowled when engaged as a ""Smoka."" As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage Capillaris Herba as a most peaceful brew/tea. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Capillaris Herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) 
 
 Capillaris Herba is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Capillaris Herba is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Capillaris Herba not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time.

        Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
        Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
         Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
         Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
         Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
         Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
         Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
         Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
         Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
          Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
          Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
          Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
           Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
           Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

995,"Greetings! 
 
 You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 
 
 If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 
 
 MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 
 
 MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. 
 The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 
 The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 
 
 HERE'S GOOD NEWS 
 
 There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 
 
 With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 
 
 I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 
 
 To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 
 
 Cordially, 
 
 Mark R Sherman 
 
 P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!
