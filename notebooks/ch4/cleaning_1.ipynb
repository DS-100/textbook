    "\n",
    "We will state important questions you should ask of all datasets before data cleaning or processing. These questions are related to how the data were generated, so data cleaning will usually **not** be able to resolve issues that arise here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do the data contain?** The website for the Calls for Service data states that the dataset describes \"crime incidents (not criminal reports) within the last 180 days\". Further reading reveals that \"not all calls for police service are included (e.g. Animal Bite)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The website for the Stops data states that the dataset contains data on all \"vehicle detentions (including bicycles) and pedestrian detentions (up to five persons)\" since January 26, 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are the data a census?** This depends on our population of interest. For example, if we are interested in calls for service within the last 180 days for crime incidents then the Calls dataset is a census. However, if we are interested in calls for service within the last 10 years the dataset is clearly not a census. We can make similar statements about the Stops dataset since the data collection started on January 26, 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the data form a sample, is it a probability sample?** If we are investigating a period of time that the data do not have entries for, the data do not form a probability sample since there is no randomness involved in the data collection process — we have all data for certain time periods but no data for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What limitations will this data have on our conclusions?** Although we will ask this question at each step of our data processing, we can already see that our data impose important limitations. The most important limitation is that we cannot make unbiased estimations for time periods not covered by our datasets."

For example, missing addresses could mean that locations were removed to protect anonymity, or that some respondents chose not to answer a survey question, or that a recording device broke.\n",
    "1. **Are there any missing values that were filled in (e.g. a 999 for unknown age or 12:00am for unknown date)?** These will clearly impact analysis if we ignore them.\n",
