On January 26, 2015 the department began collecting data pursuant to General Order B-4 (issued December 31, 2014).  Under that order, officers were required to provide certain data after making all vehicle detentions (including bicycles) and pedestrian detentions (up to five persons).  This data set lists stops by police in the categories of traffic, suspicious vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle stops.  Incident number, date and time, location and disposition codes are also listed in this data.\\r\\n\\r\\nAddress data has been changed from a specific address, where applicable, and listed as the block where the incident occurred.  Disposition codes were entered by officers who made the stop.  These codes included the person(s) race, gender, age (range), reason for the stop, enforcement action taken, and whether or not a search was conducted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officers of the Berkeley Police Department are prohibited from biased based policing, which is defined as any police-initiated action that relies on the race, ethnicity, or national origin rather than the behavior of an individual or information that leads the police to a particular individual who has been identified as being engaged in criminal activity.\",\r\n"
