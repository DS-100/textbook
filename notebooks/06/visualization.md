Data visualization is an essential tool for data science at every step of
analysis, from data cleaning to EDA to communicating conclusions and
predictions. Because human minds are highly developed for visual perception, a
well-chosen plot can often reveal trends and anomalies in the data much more
efficiently than a textual description.

To effectively use data visualizations, you must be proficient with both the
programming tools to generate plots and the principles of visualization. In
this chapter we will introduce `seaborn` and `matplotlib`, our tools of choice
for creating plots. We will also learn how to spot misleading visualizations
and how to improve visualizations using data transformations, smoothing, and
dimensionality reduction.
