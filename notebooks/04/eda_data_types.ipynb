For example: T-shirt sizes (small, medium, large), Likert-scale responses (disagree, neutral, agree), and level of education (high school, college, graduate school). Ordinal and nominal data are considered subtypes of categorical data.\n",
    "1. **Numerical data**, which represents amounts or quantities. For example: heights, prices, and distances.\n",
