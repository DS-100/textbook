This is a historical result of the fact that nearly all computers use a binary number scheme where powers of 2 are simpler to represent. You will also see the typical SI prefixes used to describe size — kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, for example. Unfortunately, these prefixes are used inconsistently. Sometimes a kilobyte refers to 1000 bytes; other times, a kilobyte refers to 1024 bytes. To avoid confusion, we will stick to kibi-, mebi-, and gibibytes which clearly represent multiples of 1024."
