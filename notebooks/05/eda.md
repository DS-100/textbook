In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the third step of the data science
lifecycle, we summarize, visualize, and transform the data in order to
understand it more deeply. In particular, through EDA we identify potential
issues in the data and discover trends that inform further analyses.

We seek to understand the following properties about our data:

1. Structure: the format of our data file.
2. Granularity: how fine or coarse each row and column is.
3. Scope: how (in)complete our data are.
4. Temporality: how the data are situation in time.
5. Faithfulness: how well the data captures "reality".

Although we introduce data cleaning and EDA separately to help organize this
book, in practice you will often switch between the two. For example,
visualizing a column may show misformatted values that you should use data
cleaning techniques to process. With this in mind, we return to the Berkeley
Police Department datasets for exploration.
