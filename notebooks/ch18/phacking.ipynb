    "# P-hacking\n",
    "As we discussed, a p-value or probability value is the chance, based on the model in the null hypothesis, that the test statistic is equal to the value that was observed in the data or is even further in the direction of the alternative. If a p-value is small, that means the tail beyond the observed statistic is small and so the observed statistic is far away from what the null predicts. This implies that the data support the alternative hypothesis better than they support the null. By convention, when we see that the p-value is below 0.05, the result is called statistically significant, and we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are dangers that present itself when the p-value is misused. *P-hacking* is the act of misusing data analysis to show that patterns in data are statistically significant, when in reality they are not. This is often done by performing multiple tests on data and only focusing on the tests that return results that are significant. \n",

    "## A/B Testing\n",
    "A/B testing is a very simple concept. We measure a statistic in a normal, controlled environment (we'll call this A), and then we compare that to the same statistic in an environment with *one* change. This form of testing is used frequently in marketing and ad research to compare the effectiveness of certain features of ads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are working for a company whose website lets users make their own custom videogames. The company has a free version, which lets users make very basic videogames, and a paid version, which gives users access to more advanced tools for making videogames. When a user has finished making a videogame via a free account, we send them to a landing page that gives them the option to sign up for a paid account. Our measured statistic in this case would be how many free users sign up for a paid account upon reaching this page. We can send half of our users one version of the page, which may have text explaining in detail the benefits of the paid account (this will be version A), and the other half of our users will get another version of the page, which may have a colorful graphic that explains some of the benefits of the paid account (this will be version B). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very specific reason why it's called A/B testing, and not A/B/C/D... testing. That is because we can very easily run into problems if we try to test multiple versions at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we have 15 different sign up pages (one is the control, in this case \"A\"), each with something different about them (one has a picture of a puppy, one has a quote from a customer, one has a graphic, etc.), and let's say that in this case, none of our variations actually has an effect on user interaction (so we can use a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a std of 0.1)."

    "As shown, the last step of the whole \"data pipeline\" is the calculation of an inferential statistic like the p-value, and having a rule applied to it (e.g. p > 0.05). But there are many other decisions that are made beforehand, like experimental design or EDA, that can have much greater effects on the results - mistakes like simple rounding or measurement errors, choosing the wrong model, or not taking into account confounding factors can change everything. By changing the way data are cleaned, summarized, or modeled, we can achieve arbitrary levels of statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example of this would be in the case of rolling a pair of dice and getting two 6s. If we were to take a null hypothesis that the dice are fair and not weighted, and take our test statistic to be the sum of the dice, we will find that the p-value of this outcome will be 1/36 or 0.028, and gives us statistically signficant results that the dice are fair. But obviously, a single roll is not nearly enough rolls to provide us with good evidence to say whether the results are statistically significant or not, and shows that blindly applying the p-value without properly designing a good experiment can result in bad results.\n",
