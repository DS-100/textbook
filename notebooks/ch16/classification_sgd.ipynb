    "Since $ L(\\hat\\theta, X, y) $ computes an average cost across an entire dataset, this gradient update equation computes a gradient using the average gradient across the entire dataset as a single batch. For this reason, this gradient update rule is often referred to as **batch gradient descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in logistic regression we use the cross entropy cost as our cost function. We replace  $\\nabla_\\hat\\theta L(\\hat\\theta, X, y)$ with the gradient of the cross entropy cost, $-\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\sigma_i)X_i$, to find the gradient descent algorithm specific to logistic regression.

    "**Mini-batch gradient descent** strikes a balance between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent by increasing the number of observations that we select at each iteration. In mini-batch gradient descent, we take a simple random sample of observations called a mini-batch. We use the average of the gradients of their loss functions to construct an estimate of the true gradient of the cross entropy cost. Since our sample is randomly selected, the expectation of this estimate is equal to the true gradient. This is illustrated in the approximation for the cost function of logistic regression, where $\\mathcal{B}$ is the mini-batch of data points that we randomly sample from the $n$ observations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mini-batch gradient descent is most optimal when running on a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) or on distributed systems. Since computations on these hardware machines can be executed in parallel, using a mini-batch can increase the accuracy of the gradient without increasing computation time. Depending on the memory of the GPU, the mini-batch size is often set between 10 and 100 observations. \n",

    "\n",
    "We use batch gradient descent to iteratively improve model parameters until the model achieves low cost. Since batch gradient descent is computationally intractable with large datasets, we often use stochastic gradient descent to fit models instead. With a GPU, mini-batch gradient descent can converge more quickly than stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although stochastic gradient descent typically takes more individual updates to converge than batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent often converges more quickly because it computes updates faster."
