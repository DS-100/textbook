On the other hand, at each iteration of stochastic gradient, our steps may not lead us in the direction of the true gradient; however, our $\\theta$ estimates eventually converge to the true loss-minimizing values. At large values of $n$, this is much more desirable due to the fast speed and low computational cost at which we can generate estimates at each iteration.\n",

Since our sample is randomly selected, the expectation of this estimate is equal to the true gradient.

    "## Selecting the Mini-Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The mini-batch size is often set to small numbers such as 1 or 2 to minimize computational cost. However, when working with parallel machines such as a GPU or a distributed computing system, we can increase the mini-batch size to take advantage of the hardware. Since mini-batches can be computed in parallel, the runtime of larger mini-batches is roughly equivalent to the runtime of stochastic gradient descent.\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch gradient descent allows us to minimize the loss of the cost function at each iteration and take direct steps towards the loss-minimizing $\\theta$ parameters. However, using the entire batch of $n$ observations can become computationally expensive for large $n$; in such scenarios, we use stochastic gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent. While they may take noisier paths to the loss-minimizing $\\theta$ parameters, they also reduce runtime by only computing the loss gradient over a small mini-batch of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have made the distinction between stochastic and mini-batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent is sometimes used as an umbrella term that encompasses the selection of a mini-batch of any size. "
