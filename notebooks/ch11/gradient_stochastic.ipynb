This involved taking the derivative of the MSE, setting it to zero, and solving for $\\hat\\theta$. We found that the MSE-minimizing $\\hat\\theta$ value was simply the mean of the $y$ values in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for more complicated models and loss functions, there may not be simple algebraic expressions that yield the loss-minimizing $\\hat\\theta$ values. Our solution was a new method called gradient descent, which iteratively updates $\\hat\\theta$ until it doesn't change between iterations. To complete an iteration of gradient descent, we calculate the following:\n",

Since the observation is chosen randomly, we expect that using the gradient at each individual observation will eventually converge the algorithm to the same parameters as batch gradient descent. The general update formula for stochastic gradient descent is below, where $l(\\hat\\theta, y_i)$ is the loss function for a single data point:\n",

    "Stochastic gradient descent relies on the random selection of individual observations. This is statistically founded since the randomness means that $E[\\nabla_{\\hat\\theta}l(\\hat\\theta, y_i)] = \\nabla_{\\hat\\theta}L(\\hat\\theta, y)$. In practice, we choose these random data points by shuffling the training data and iteratively selecting from the shuffled data. An iteration through all $n$ observations of the shuffled data is called an **epoch**; at the end of every epoch, we re-shuffle the data to ensure that the model sees data points in an arbitrary order."

Although stochastic gradient descent typically takes more iterations to converge than batch gradient descent, it often converges more quickly because it spends significantly less time computing the update at each iteration."

Since our sample is randomly selected, the expectation of this estimate is equal to the true gradient.

    "We use batch gradient descent to iteratively improve model parameters until the model achieves minimal loss. Since batch gradient descent is computationally intractable with large datasets, we often use stochastic gradient descent to fit models instead. Furthermore, when using a GPU, mini-batch gradient descent can converge more quickly than stochastic gradient descent for the same computational cost. For large datasets, stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent are often preferred to batch gradient descent for their faster computation times."
