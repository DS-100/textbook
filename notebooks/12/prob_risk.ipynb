The constant model has a single parameter, $ \\theta $. We found that the optimizing parameter $ \\hat{\\theta} = \\text{mean}(\\textbf y) $ for the MSE loss.\n",

If our model achieves a low risk, our model will make accurate predictions on points from the population in the long term.

To clarify, $ \\theta^* $ represents the model parameter that minimizes risk while $ \\hat{\\theta} $ represents the parameter that minimizes dataset-specific loss."
