# Web Technologies

Before the Internet, data scientists had to physically move hard disk drives to
share data with others. Now, we can freely retrieve datasets from computers
across the world.

Although we use the Internet to download and share data files, the web pages on
the Internet themselves contain huge amounts of information as text, images,
and videos. By learning web technologies, we can use the Web as a data source.
In this chapter, we introduce HTTP, the primary communication protocol for the
Web, and XML/HTML, the primary document formats for web pages.
