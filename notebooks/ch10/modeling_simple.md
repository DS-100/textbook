## Models

In the United States, many diners will leave a tip for their waiter or waitress as the diners pay for the meal. Although it is customary to offer 15% of the total bill as tip, perhaps some restaurants have more generous patrons than others.

One particular waiter was so interested in how much tip he could expect to get that he collected a simple random sample of information about the tables he served.


```python
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
tips
```

We can plot a histogram of the tip amounts:


```python
sns.distplot(tips['tip'], bins=np.arange(0, 10.1, 0.25), rug=True)
plt.xlabel('Tip Amount in Dollars')
plt.ylabel('Proportion per Dollar');
```

There are already some interesting patterns in the data. For example, there is a clear mode at \$2 and most tips seem to be in multiples of \$0.50.

For now, we are most interested in the percent tip: the tip amount divided by the bill amount. We can create a column in our DataFrame for this variable and show its distribution.


```python
tips['pcttip'] = tips['tip'] / tips['total_bill'] * 100
sns.distplot(tips['pcttip'], rug=True)
plt.xlabel('Percent Tip Amount')
plt.ylabel('Proportion per Percent');
```

It looks like one table left our waiter a tip of 70%! However, most of the tips percentages are under 30%. Let's zoom into that part of the distribution.


```python
sns.distplot(tips['pcttip'], bins=np.arange(30), rug=True)
plt.xlim(0, 30)
plt.xlabel('Percent Tip Amount')
plt.ylabel('Proportion per Percent');
```

We can the distribution is roughly centered at 15% with another potential mode at 20%. Suppose our waiter is interested in predicting how much percent tip he will get from a given table. To address this question, we can create a model for how much tip the waiter will get.

### A Simple Model

The simplest model possible is to completely ignore the data and state that since the convention in the U.S. is to give 15% tip, the waiter will always get 15% tip from his tables. While simple, let's use this model to define some variables that we'll use later on.

This model assumes that there is one true percentage tip that all tables, past and future, will give the waiter. This is the *population parameter* for the percent tip, which we will denote by $ \theta^* $.

After making this assumption, our model then says that our guess for $ \theta^* $ is $ 15\% $. We will use $\theta$ to represent our estimate.

In mathematical notation, our model states that:

$$ \theta = 15 $$

This model is obviously wrongâ€”if the model were accurate, every table in our dataset should have given the waiter exactly 15% tip. However, this model will probably make a reasonable guess for most scenarios. In fact, if we had no data on previous tables and their percent tips this model would be a good choice. Still, the question remains: what if 10% is a better estimate? Or 20%? Without data, we are mostly limited to blind guesses.

However, since our waiter's dataset was sampled at random from our population of interest, our sample will likely resemble the population. This key insight allows us to use our sample to evaluate the accuracy of our model. In particular, we can use the sample of tip percentages to decide whether 10%, 15%, 20%, or some other percent is the best choice for our estimate $\theta$.

### Cost Function Intuition

The distribution of tip percents from our dataset is replicated below for convenience.


```python
# HIDDEN
sns.distplot(tips['pcttip'], bins=np.arange(30), rug=True)
plt.xlim(0, 30)
plt.xlabel('Percent Tip Amount')
plt.ylabel('Proportion per Percent');
```

Let's suppose we are trying to compare two choices for $\theta$: 10% and 15%. We can mark both of these choices on our distribution:


```python
# HIDDEN
sns.distplot(tips['pcttip'], bins=np.arange(30), rug=True)

plt.axvline(x=10, c='darkblue', linestyle='--', label=r'$ \theta = 10$')
plt.axvline(x=15, c='goldenrod', linestyle='--', label=r'$ \theta = 15$')
plt.legend()

plt.xlim(0, 30)
plt.xlabel('Percent Tip Amount')
plt.ylabel('Proportion per Percent');
```

Intuitively, it looks like choosing $ \theta = 15 $ makes more sense than $ \theta = 10 $ given our dataset. Why is this? When we look at the points in our data, we can see that more points fall close to 15 than they do to 10.

Although in this case it is clear that $ \theta = 15 $ is a better choice than $ \theta = 10 $, it is not so clear whether $ \theta = 15 $ is a better choice than $ \theta = 16 $. By assigning a specific number that measures how "good" a given choice of $ \theta $ is, we make precise choices between different values of $ \theta $. This is a mathematical function that takes in a value of $ \theta $ and the points in our dataset, outputting a single number that we will use to select the best value of $ \theta $ that we can.

We call this function a *cost function*.
