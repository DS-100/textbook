## Exploratory Data Analysis

The term Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short) refers to the process of discovering traits about our data that inform future analysis.

Here's the `students` table from the previous page:


```python
students
```

We are left with a number of questions. How many students are in this roster? What does the `Role` column mean? We conduct EDA in order to understand our data more thoroughly.

**In Data 100 we will study exploratory data analysis and practice analyzing new datasets.**

Oftentimes, we explore the data by repeatly posing simple questions about the data that we'd like to know about. We will structure our analysis this way.

**How many students are in our dataset?**


```python
print("There are", len(students), "students on the roster.")
```

A natural follow-up question is whether this is the complete list of students or not. In this case, we happen to know that this list contains all students in the class.

**What is the meaning of the `Role` field?**

Understanding the meaning of field can often be achieved by looking at the unique values of the field's data:


```python
students['Role'].value_counts().to_frame()
```

We can see here that our data contain not only students enrolled in the class at the time but also the students on the waitlist. The `Role` column tells us whether each student is enrolled.

**What about the names?  How can we summarize this field?**

In Data 100 we will deal with many different kinds of data (not just numbers) and we will study techniques to diverse types of data.

A good starting point might be to examine the lengths of the strings.


```python
sns.distplot(students['Name'].str.len(), rug=True, axlabel="Number of Characters")
```

This visualization shows us that most names are between 3 and 9 characters long. This gives us a chance to check whether our data seem reasonable â€” if there were many names that were 1 character long we'd have good reason to re-examine our data.

## What's in a Name?

Although this dataset is rather simple, we will soon see that first names alone can reveal quite a bit about our class.
