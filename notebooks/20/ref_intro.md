## Reference Tables

This appendix contains reference tables for the `pandas`, `seaborn`,
`matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` methods used in the book. It is meant to
provide a helpful overview of the small subset of methods that we use most
often in this book.

For each library, we list the methods used, the chapter where each method is
first mentioned, and a brief description of the method's functionality.
