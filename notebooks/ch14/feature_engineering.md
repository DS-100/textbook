# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering refers to the practice of creating and adding new features
to the dataset itself in order to add complexity to our models.

So far we have only conducted linear regression using numerical features
as the inputâ€”we used the (numeric) total bill in order to predict the tip
amount. However, the tip dataset also contained categorical data, such as the
day of week and the meal type. Feature engineering allows us to convert
categorical variables into numerical features for linear regression.

Feature engineering also allows us to use our linear regression model to
conduct polynomial regression by creating new variables in our dataset.
