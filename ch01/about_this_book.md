## About This Book

Before we continue, it is important for us to state our assumptions about the
reader.

In this book, we will proceed as though you have taken [Data 8][data8] or some
equivalent. In particular, we will assume that you have some familiarity with
the following topics (links to pages from the Data 8 textbook are given in
parentheses).

* Tabular data manipulation: selection, filtering, grouping, joining [(link)][8.2]
* Sampling, empirical distributions of statistics [(link)][10.3]
* Hypothesis testing using bootstrap resampling [(link)][13.4]
* Least squares regression and regression inference [(link)][16.2]
* Classification [(link)][17.1]

In addition, we will assume that you have taken [CS61A][61a] or some equivalent
and thus will not explain Python syntax except in special cases.
