## About This Book

In this book, we will proceed as though the reader is comfortable with the
knowledge presented in [Data 8][data8] or some equivalent. In particular, we
will assume that the reader has some familiarity with the following topics
(links to pages from the Data 8 textbook are given in parentheses).

* Tabular data manipulation: selection, filtering, grouping, joining [(link)][8.2]
* Basic probability concepts [(link)][9.5]
* Sampling, empirical distributions of statistics [(link)][10.3]
* Hypothesis testing using bootstrap resampling [(link)][13.4]
* Least squares regression and regression inference [(link)][16.2]
* Classification [(link)][17.1]

In addition, we assume that the reader has taken a course in computer
programming in Python, such as [CS61A][61a] or some equivalent. We will not
explain Python syntax except in special cases.
