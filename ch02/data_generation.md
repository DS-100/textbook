# Data Generation

Data science would hardly be a science without data. It is thus of utmost
importance that we begin any data analysis by understanding how our data were
generated.

In this chapter, we will discuss **data provenance**. Although the term data
provenance typically refers to the entire history of data and where it has
moved over time, we will use the term in this textbook to refer to the process
that generated our data. Many have drawn premature conclusions because they
were not careful enough in understanding their data; we will discuss an example
of this to justify the importance of probability sampling in conducting data
science.
