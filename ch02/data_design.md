# Data Design

Data science would hardly be a science without data. It is thus of utmost
importance that we begin any data analysis by understanding how our data were
collected.

In this chapter, we will discuss **data design**, the process that we use to
collect our data. Many have drawn premature conclusions because they were not
careful enough in understanding their data design; we will use examples and
simulations to justify the importance of probability sampling in conducting
data science.
