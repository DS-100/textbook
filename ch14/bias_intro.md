# The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Sometimes, we choose a model that is too simple to represent the underlying
data generation process. Other times, we choose a model that is too complexâ€”it
fits the noise in the data rather than the data's overall pattern.

To understand why this happens, we analyze our models using the tools of
probability and statistics. These tools allow us to generalize beyond a few
isolated examples to describe fundamental phenomena in modeling. We
introduce expectation and variance, then use them to uncover the bias-variance
tradeoff.
